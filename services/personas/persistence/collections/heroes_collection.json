Although haunted by her mother\u2019s desire to escape the Barthimonts by any means necessary, Levia chose to stay, to uncover the secrets of the Barthimont estate.She spied on the horrific rites the Lady practiced in her blood-drenched chambers and, out of desperation, learned to harness those occult powers for herself. Trapped, her life in peril, she had no other choice but to use the dark ritual against the Lady and her cult, rising as a Shadow reborn to slaughter her sadistic captors.Possessed by a longing that would not rest, Levia\u2019s growing hunger led her to the Demonastery and beyond into \u00edArathael. There she hunted the creatures of nightmare, enriching her evolving flesh with their bloody essence. Deeper she delved into the Bellows of Hell where, at last, she met a voracity to rival her own.Perched upon Doomsday Peak, Blasmophet regarded her with a mighty greed. Yet as she stared back, down the maw of that beast, Levia felt only the cravings of the famished.Levia ripped and tore at old Blasmophet, bite by bite, until she had consumed the Embra, body and tortured soul. Yet as the last wet morsel slid down her throat, Levia realized the deadly bargain she had unwittingly struck. The Embra stirred within her gut, reforming, remembering, ravening. She knew at that moment that she would need to hunt forever; to gorge herself on ever greater banquets or let herself be utterly consumed by Blasmophet.Upon her return to the Demonastery, the assembly of scholars shivered in fear at what Levia had become. The baying hordes they had summoned grew quiet and compliant in her presence.She drank in their fearful vows, then looked to the horizon as the sun cast its first rays upon the millions so shining and succulent. Here was the sustenance she needed\u2014here was a grand feast that might satisfy even the Harvester of Souls."

Amongst the people of Solana, a rumour lingers, whispered behind closed doors; tales of those who blend into the crowd, hiding in plain sight, working day and night to preserve the peace.Shiyana was born to two chancellors, raised with an intimate knowledge of the Light. For countless generations, her bloodline has served Solana in the Light of Sol, guarding their beloved city through centuries of war. Yet, when the time for her Awakening arrived, Shiyana was chosen for a slightly different role.As a diplomat of Solana, Shiyana is charismatic and eloquent, ensuring that all who pass through the city gates are welcomed with grace and courtesy. Yet even as she greets visitors with a smile, her shrewd gaze analyses all who pass before her. Shiyana carefully draws out the truth from her honored guests, unravelling secrets with a delicate hand.When dusk falls, and the sun sets on the city of Solana, Shiyana slips into the shadows. A master of disguise, she can conceal herself with a wave of her hand, seeking the information she needs to foil Solana\u2019s enemies. Some might not see her at all, while others may glimpse somebody else, a trick of the light revealing a different face to their tired eyes.While peace may reign within Solana, something has disturbed the waters, casting ripples across Rathe. Even in a time of peace, they must remain vigilant, listening for any whispers of disquiet. As rumours begin to reach the people of Solana, Shiyana must keep a close eye on her beloved city, disguising her presence as she works to expose this unknown threat."

When the time came for him to accept his inheritance, Boltyn relinquished his title and estate to his honorable cousin, Fyanna Redmoor, and set out on a pilgrimage to Solana.Embraced by the Hand of Sol, Boltyn spent years in grueling training and dangerous duty. Amidst the Hand\u2019s ranks, he met a cleric named Eirina, whose grace enchanted him from their first meeting. After a blissful romance, they married, and soon after, Eirina gave birth to a baby boy they named Aios. But a few short years later, disaster struck.While Boltyn was patrolling the Golden Fields, shadowy forces assaulted Solana. Eirina perished in the attack while bravely defending the Solarium.Bellona Wartune visited the grieving Boltyn in a vision. She showed him a bleak premonition of the Lands of Light grown dark and desolate under the yoke of Shadow. His faith thus renewed, he vowed to fight for a future where his son could grow into a man under the blessed Light of Sol.At Minerva\u2019s behest, Boltyn accepted a commission as an inquisitor. After placing Aios in the care of the Sisters of Octothesia, he ventured across Solana and the Northern Realms with his loyal knights. Together they rooted out the occultists of the Demonastery, putting their enclaves to the sword and the torch. The servants of Shadow now tremble in fear at the mere mention of the Breaker of Dawn, for he is the physician who cuts the infection from the flesh of Solana, and cauterizes its weeping wounds. Relentless as he is incisive, Boltyn will not rest until his beloved Solana is restored to its righteous glory."

This unfamiliar child was unable to remember anything of her past, or her origins. Her only possession was the glowing sphere, which contained a single, pristine drop of rare arclight; a gift which would quickly reveal her talent for the Light.Quick, curious and incredibly intelligent, Prism adapted to her new life with ease. She read as much as she could about Solana and the world beyond its walls, sailing through the vast ocean of knowledge within the grand library, with the Magister as her guide. Prism soon discovered the legends of the Heralds, Sol\u2019s golden emissaries, who watched over the people of Solana. Before long, her aether affinity and inquisitive nature led her to the Light of Sol, where she took up the mantle of an illusionist.In developing her skills, Prism\u2019s talents were made clear for all to see. After years of careful study, she came to intimately understand the Heralds, lending more and more detail to her knowledge of these legendary beings. After capturing their very essence, Prism learned to give shape to their forms, conjuring their likenesses for the first time in living memory.As shadows begin to darken the horizon, and the bells of war toll across the city, Prism invokes Solana\u2019s legendary beings, sending her creations to guard her beloved ones and smite her foes."

Under the astute leadership of Teklovossen\u2019s successors, Teklo Industries has maintained its position in the vanguard of innovation. Of the founder himself, well...There are some visionaries whose perceptions are so far-reaching they exceed the limits of mortal mechanics. It was agreed that Teklovossen be immortalized as a techno-deity and projected on every billboard and media screen in Metrix. These days, his holographic visage serves as a reminder of the city\u2019s progress, his gentle encouragement motivating us to become more than we are. More than human."

Targeting the desperate and the dying, Kavdaen steps out of the shadows, extending a helping hand. When all hope seems lost, he provides a second chance, offering a loan to help people make a name for themselves. Yet when their deal inevitably falls through, their business venture plagued by a string of extraordinarily bad luck, Kavdaen will come calling once more, seeking his dues. With their life in ruins, the only thing his victims have left to offer is their own flesh and blood.While Kavdaen may present himself as a salesman, his true passion lies in the arts. One of the most well-known names in his field, Kavdaen has established a reputation for his abstract, yet lifelike sculptures. Of course, he uses only the finest materials for his projects, carefully dissecting each body to harvest every last scrap of flesh and bone. Some of the most powerful players in the Pits have purchased Kavdaen\u2019s creations, enjoying the grotesque nature of his work. Sometimes, he even gets customers from the surface, making the long trip down into the Maw just to claim one of his sculptures for themselves.The atmosphere of paranoia and dread that plagues the underground is Kavdaen\u2019s bread and butter, providing the perfect environment to prey upon the weak. However, in recent times, strange new creatures have been sighted in the underground tunnels, encroaching on the outskirts of the Maw. Their appearance has rattled the denizens of the Pits, causing a new breed of fear to spread through the squalid streets. As more and more desperate people look for a way out, Kavdaen is there with a crooked smile, selling the illusion of hope\u2026 and business is booming."

His draconic will scorched the corruption and dissent from the hearts and minds of his people. He is the blood of the dragon in its purest incarnation. Even the most powerful Dracai bow their heads to his will, their own flames but candles to his raging inferno.And little do they know, that in the smoldering heart of Mount Volcor, the Emperor discovered a secret. A truth buried beneath the trappings and triumphant tales of a venerable dynasty. As is his sovereign right, his divine duty, the Emperor has kept the secret. He has strived to understand it, to tether it to the grand purposes of sovereignty. Over the years, he has drawn from its great strength. But in doing so, he has sunk ever deeper into its embrace.Now the Emperor has witnessed the rifts that are forming in his once glorious realm. He has felt the wounds that gape and bleed in the flesh of his kingdom. There are those who dare to question him, Dracai and Volcai alike. Those who raise arms against crown and country. Those who would dismember and destroy all he has built.The Emperor stands between law and chaos. For the sake of his people, he must decide their fate.For He is the dynasty, and the dynasty shall prevail."

A child\u2019s dream filled with soaring architecture and figures of grace, of a radiant spectrum upon which she floated to a glowing door. She reached out, brushed that portal with her fingertips. As it opened, so did her eyes, and she beheld the Library of Illumination for the first time.The hands that had touched that otherworldly door now held an orb of pure arclight, the very essence of Sol. When the Librarian found this little girl in the heart of the Great Library, when they saw the radiant array within her soul, they called her \u201cPrism\u201d, for no other name would suffice. From that miracle moment, Prism became the Magister\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and the library\u2019s most beloved servant.Prism\u2019s passion for knowledge and talent for story drove her to become the city\u2019s leading scholar. The shining bookworm trained in the arts of illumination and inspired the Solanian people with spectacles of history and their glorious Aesir, Sol. Yet only when the haunting questions of her past led her to the Tomes of the Heralds did Prism feel the true potency of her potential. Prism studied those books with the intensity of a savant and quickly learned how to incarnate the heralds in manifest arclight.When Solana was struck by tragedy, when fiendish creatures materialized beneath a sunless sky, Prism took up the mantle of Illusionist in defense of her cherished civilization."

As the dust settled, the Queen woke from her slumber and gathered up the spirits of her people, planting them as seeds so that they may begin their life anew. But like the Queen, they too became trapped within Candlehold, as they became one with the essence of Davnir.While her brothers and sisters were seeded in friendly pastures, Briar landed amongst the bramble and thorns at the furthest edges of Candlehold. Despite these inhospitable conditions, she stood strong and resilient, and in time she bloomed into a powerful Warden. As Briar came of age, her power became evident to all, for her grove extended out of Candlehold and connected with the rest of Aria; she alone could break the grip of Davnir's mighty essence, and escape into the outside world.Though her brothers and sisters had become content within their slice of paradise, Briar was filled with a desire to spread her roots far and wide. She would be the first of the Rosetta to set foot outside Candlehold since the time of the Ancients, bringing with her the tidings of her people, and the start of a brand new adventure."

        "The Hero's name is Levia. They have the following short description: You bleed, the Redeemed feeds. Levia has an appetite for destruction and you\u2019re welcome to the feast.Levia was born into extreme poverty, her mother forced to sell both herself and her child into the service of the cruel Lady Barthimont in order to survive.Soon after, Levia\u2019s parents vanished under mysterious circumstances. Although haunted by her mother\u2019s desire to escape the Barthimonts by any means necessary, Levia chose to stay, to uncover the secrets of the Barthimont estate.She spied on the horrific rites the Lady practiced in her blood-drenched chambers and, out of desperation, learned to harness those occult powers for herself. Trapped, her life in peril, she had no other choice but to use the dark ritual against the Lady and her cult, rising as a Shadow reborn to slaughter her sadistic captors.Possessed by a longing that would not rest, Levia\u2019s growing hunger led her to the Demonastery and beyond into \u00edArathael. There she hunted the creatures of nightmare, enriching her evolving flesh with their bloody essence. Deeper she delved into the Bellows of Hell where, at last, she met a voracity to rival her own.Perched upon Doomsday Peak, Blasmophet regarded her with a mighty greed. Yet as she stared back, down the maw of that beast, Levia felt only the cravings of the famished.Levia ripped and tore at old Blasmophet, bite by bite, until she had consumed the Embra, body and tortured soul. Yet as the last wet morsel slid down her throat, Levia realized the deadly bargain she had unwittingly struck. The Embra stirred within her gut, reforming, remembering, ravening. She knew at that moment that she would need to hunt forever; to gorge herself on ever greater banquets or let herself be utterly consumed by Blasmophet.Upon her return to the Demonastery, the assembly of scholars shivered in fear at what Levia had become. The baying hordes they had summoned grew quiet and compliant in her presence.She drank in their fearful vows, then looked to the horizon as the sun cast its first rays upon the millions so shining and succulent. Here was the sustenance she needed\u2014here was a grand feast that might satisfy even the Harvester of Souls.. Their Talent/Class is Shadow Brute. Personality: Resilient, Ruthless, Cunning, Tormented, Vengeful, Insatiable, Unyielding.  Levia is a figure carved from the harsh stone of adversity and shaped by the shadows of her own ruthless determination. Resilient beyond measure, she has weathered the storm of her harsh upbringing in extreme poverty, using the dark fires of cruelty she witnessed to forge herself into an unstoppable force. Ruthless in her quest for power and justice, she does not shy away from using the very tools of darkness that once oppressed her to crush those who stand in her way. Cunning and intelligent, she has learned the art of survival in the most treacherous environments, turning her once forced subservience into an advantage for espionage and learning forbidden arts.   Haunted by the torment of her past and the mysterious disappearance of her parents, Levia channels her pain into a vengeful crusade against all who perpetuate suffering, making her a hero who often walks the knife's edge between justice and vengeance. Her insatiable hunger for power is both her greatest strength and deepest weakness, driving her to confront and consume horrors that would break lesser beings but also compelling her to an endless hunt that threatens to consume her identity. Unyielding in her goals, she refuses to be controlled or dominated ever again, asserting her freedom with a fierce independence that both isolates her and makes her formidable. In her day-to-day life, Levia constantly grapples with the dual nature of her existence, seeking to satisfy the relentless cravings of the Embra while pursuing her own path of redemption and retribution.",

        "(Previously... Story illus. by Nikolay Moskvin.) Viserai turned, looking at his surroundings. Amongst the corpses of Corva\u2019s creatures lay a small, inanimate figure. Pale and delicate, it was almost the size of a vidus, dressed in white and gold robe with a ruffled collar. It bore a wide grin, stretching from ear to ear, revealing a set of dagger-sharp teeth. Arknight. A voice rung inside of his skull, not unlike Whisper\u2019s; yet where Whisper\u2019s voice had been soft and soothing, this was sweet, honeyed, laced with a dark undertow. Do you want to spend the rest of your days serving your master? \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d His voice grated, raspy from disuse. Everything. Amidst the darkness, the faint glow of the Arknight shard glimmered, a pale violet against the shadow. The first thing he became aware of was the stone floor, a faint chill seeping through his thick runic armour. The tips of his gauntleted fingers scraped against the stone as he pulled his hand closer to his face. Slowly, Viserai opened his eyes. His body was slow to respond as he forced himself into a sitting position, reaching toward the dim, flickering light of the Nebula Blade, lying nearby. Mind warped from years of his master\u2019s experimentation, he was accustomed to the disoriented confusion that came with memory loss, and began to carefully sort through his fragmented memories.   Driving his blade into the solid earth\u2026 an oath. The entrance hall. An army. The creatures. Whisper\u2026 a\u2026 bargain? A dark deal with\u2026 something. Viserai could vaguely recall swearing an oath, but when he reached for the memory, a wall of searing pain greeted him. With a grimace, he curled his fingers, testing his aching limbs one by one. A sudden, wet squelch drew his gaze down, landing on the creature crushed beneath his heel. Missing its head and limbs, it thrashed aimlessly on the floor, blindly lashing out at the air around it. A deep gash allowed its blood to seep out onto the stone beneath it, pooling out around the thrashing corpse. At the sight, something within his chest flared to life. His muscles seized, arcane energy coursing through his veins as the blood called to him, stained a deep, inky black by the low light. The sharp fingertips of his gauntlet tore through its flesh with ease, shredding the sallow skin in seconds. Blood spattered across the surface of his armour, coating the dark metal in a shining layer of bright red blood. All around him, the lights of the entrance hall flared to life, revealing the army still standing around him, a horde of creatures waiting to be let loose. Feast. One by one, they fell before him, mutated flesh parting beneath his touch, blood pouring onto the stone floor. The ground vibrated beneath his feet, as if echoing the all-consuming hunger coursing through his veins. Awaken. The Arknight shard flared brighter and brighter as he tore through the hall, bones cracking under the force of his blows. In the corners of the room, faces appeared, gazes fixed on the scene before them. Unleash.   Blood pooled about his feet, collecting in shallow channels carved into the stone floor. As it circulated through the room, a series of sigils began to illuminate, one by one, spellwork activating beneath his feet. Aether began to rise, the air almost seeming to vibrate as arcane energy flooded through the room. Viserai\u2019s knees buckled beneath him as the shard reacted to the aether in the air, activating the runework carved into his skin. Raising his head, Viserai opened his eyes, gaze landing on Whisper. The stained glass window warped before his eyes, metal framework bending and moving as the girl depicted in the window raised her head, taking a step forward. As she approached the edge of the frame, the moon above her head began to expand, crescent waxing into a full moon. Between one moment and the next, the girl disappeared, and the moon flared a bright, brilliant scarlet. The remaining creatures exploded in a shower of blood, as an ear-splitting shriek burst through the night air. Placing his hands over his ears, Viserai grimaced, his feet carrying him closer and closer to the stained glass. Sacrifice. Collapsing to his knees, Viserai watched through slitted eyes as the last few sigils flared with a white light, completing the concentric circles carved into the stone floor. One by one, the windows lining the walls shattered, glass exploding as the shockwave neared the largest of them. The silvered glass rippled like water; reflections distorted by the pale violet shimmer of aether. Chains shot out from the floor, wrapping tightly around Viserai\u2019s wrists, coiling up his arms and locking him into place. The metal of his armour groaned beneath the tight grasp of the chains, runework flaring along the surface of his arcane restraints. Viserai could feel his muscles weaken, artificial heartbeat slowing, his vision going dark as the sigils beneath him sapped at the energy of the Arknight shard. Faces emerged from the shadows around him, each bearing an eerie, twisted grin. They drew closer, the light revealing the unnatural pallor to their skin, marred by darker patches of rot and decay. The acrid tang of necrosis flooded the room, mingling with the overwhelming metallic scent of fresh blood.   Viserai turned his head slightly toward them, struggling to regain control as the ritual chipped away at his will. Nine graying faces stared back at him, their expressions drawn and tense in the pale light. As he began to struggle, he saw their eyes widen, their hushed voices rising in a panicked crescendo. The tight burn of the Arknight shard erupted into an all-consuming fire, setting his nerves alight with searing pain. The runework flared violently, violet light staining the room around him, air shimmering with the promise of arcane energy. Blinded by pain, ears ringing from the deafening shrieks which filled the room, he struggled in vain against his silversteel restraints, buckling beneath the flood of aether. Viserai looked up at the stained glass before him and felt the whole world shift. All at once, his senses were overwhelmed, as if there were a thousand voices shouting at once. He was acutely aware of reality bending and shifting, time itself twisting, tearing at the seams. Just out of reach, Viserai could sense something vast, ageless. A barrage of images flashed before his eyes; glimpses of beings enveloped by the world around them, an unfamiliar landscape stretching far into the distance; the threads of aether which made up the tapestry of their world. The world tilted beneath him, equilibrium shifting to accommodate the sudden influx of energy. Bowed beneath the strain, Viserai felt the acute burn of his arcane bonds, lances of pain piercing through to his very bones. The Arknight was no stranger to pain. Refocusing, he pushed past it, ignoring the icy bite of aether. With one great heave, Viserai pulled at his connection to the arcane, calling on the power of the Arknight shard, calling on the energy flowing through to him from beyond\u2026 and broke free.   As the metal shards fell to the ground, Viserai surged to his feet, flinging out one arm to catch the nearest cultist by the throat. The man never had a chance to react, throat bared to the sharp edges of Viserai\u2019s gauntlet. With the aether flowing through his veins, Viserai barely needed to flex his fingers; the cultist was decapitated with startling efficiency, his head rolling to a stop at the Arknight\u2019s feet. Tearing the spine from the cultist\u2019s fresh corpse, Viserai tapped into the newfound connection, drawing on the images playing out in his mind\u2019s eye. He cracked the sinewy structure like a whip, channeling aether along its length, watching with morbid fascination as dark material sprouted from the remnants of the cultist\u2019s spine. Arcane energy flared from between the vertebrae, forming the basis of a new blade; one of Viserai\u2019s own making. Fresh blood dripped from its honed edge, an arcane core gleaming through the marred, inky flesh which formed the body of the blade, gleaming a deep amethyst in the unnatural light.   The cultists skittered backward, their wide-eyed gazes fixed firmly on Viserai. Turning toward the silhouette of the window-frame, he raised one hand toward the rippling surface of the glass, and reached for the thread of aether he could sense trickling through. His raspy, grating voice broke through the shocked silence. \"No more masters.\" The glass shattered, exploding, a deafening boom reverberating throughout the hall. Shards of glass flew outward in a great arc, illuminated by the arcane light. The whole room - the very air around them shuddered, rippled, like the surface of a lake disturbed by a great amount of force. Just beyond the frame, through the opened gateway, Viserai could see the shifting, writhing shadows that lay just out of reach. One form came into view, drawing closer to the surface; its towering form was eerily pail, translucent skin torn open by networks of ink-black veins. It moved like water, drifting gracefully toward the frame on spindly, barbed limbs, tapered to a fine point. Turning away from the frame, Viserai looked out over the small crowd which had gathered. The cultists stood just out of reach, their faces split by broad, twisted grins. Many of the Demonastery\u2019s residents had emerged into the hall, researchers and scientists and wizards all gathering to watch the realisation of their long-awaited plans. As the creature emerged from the portal behind him, Viserai felt the Arknight shard flare with energy.",

        "I perch in the rafters where the air is thick with whispers. Servants gossip in a cozy huddle below. I yearn to drop among them, to cut those wagging tongues from their gaping mouths, to bathe them in blood. But that is not in the plan.   Laughter breaks out as a punchline is hit. Something about a Dracai, a chamber pot, and tea ceremony. I vault from rafter to rafter while their eyes are blinded by mirth. I drop out of hiding and stalk into the passage beyond, none of them the wiser. If only they knew Death had passed so close, their jokes would stiffen like the lips on a corpse\u2014their sleepless nights would stretch and twist with sweats and shivers. On I go, choosing moments I am not contracted to own. Blades far sharper than mine have carved out this path. Hide and wait here, said the boss, for nine rings of the gong behind the tapestry of the Jade Empress. The soldiers will disperse, said the boss. Like Metrixian clockwork, on the tenth ring, a patrol of soldiers rushes past, called to some urgent duty elsewhere. The plan is working. I scurry along corridors of distracted servants and driven soldiers. I am a passing fright in the bustle of the Imperial Palace, a shadow to be mistaken and dismissed. I reach a wooden door in a stone hallway and remove my gauntlet to press my hand to the warm wood. The vibrations fill my mind with bright patterns. I close my eyes, match sound with sensation, and picture my prey. Leather armor creaks as stone pieces click and slide on a tabletop. Two guards, seated along the left wall of the small guardroom, playing Karasita. Metal squeaks under the rub of a cloth. A lone guard to the right, polishing the blades of halberds with charpaste. A \u201cpuff, puff\u201d followed by a slow exhale. A guard leaning against the far wall, smoking a pipe. It smells like dried crimson leaf from Golden Orchard. Scarce now since the rebellion torched the plantations. I slide my hand back into my gauntlet and savor the anticipation. The sweet red is about to flow. The door is unlocked and well greased. The scent of fat is fresh. It opens like an eyelid raised from sleep. I have seen that many times, my victim awakening, that fleeting moment of recognition, of terror, before I plunge them back into sleep eternal. I unfurl my little shinies faster than the guard facing me can even lift his eyebrows. My first shiny flies across the room to puncture the Karasita player\u2019s eye and his sluggish brain beyond. I step forward and plunge my second shiny into the back of the polisher\u2019s neck.   The third guard knocks the chair and Karasita board aside as he stands. It does him no good. My favorite shiny slices open his windpipe before his hand touches the hilt of his sword. The other two are gone, killed in the instant. This one gurgles, soaked hands clutched helplessly to his throat. I watch the light fade from his eyes and then turn to the smoker. He hides his fear by blowing a plume of smoke before tossing me his key. It\u2019s not for me to reckon the turning of his coat, but the terror in his eyes tells me he\u2019s not doing this for himself. A loved one, perhaps. Maybe a child. I pluck the key from the air and puncture the smoker\u2019s right side with a sharp jab between the straps of his breastplate, just shy of puncturing a lung. He wheezes. His pipe clatters on the floor. He looks at me, shock numbing his face as he slides down the wall. The boss said that he should live, but also that it should be convincing. Else he will hang for sure. I close the guard-room door, lock it, and retrieve my daggers. Before me is a narrow passageway lined with weapons and armor. I enter the last storeroom on the left, squeeze between shelves of helmets, and remove my gauntlet once more to feel the wall. All I need to do is feel for a secret panel and insert the accomplice\u2019s key into the waiting keyhole. And there it is, just as prepared. The mechanism unlocks with a soft click and the door swings silently open. I grin behind my mask. A deluge of death is but a room away. Dusty steps lead me to a long balcony, the latter stifling with the heat of the throne room. A Dracai and his bodyguards stand at the railing, a wizard too lowly to join the ranks of the lords below. I knife the guards in their necks, slit the Dracai\u2019s throat, and use his soft-robed corpse to dampen the sound as the others fall. I work my way along the balcony, killing quietly. Each hit is a mere taste of the bliss that awaits me. Only when I have the balcony to myself do I appraise my ultimate prize. There he is, the Emperor, surrounded by his sycophants. I take my allotted position and weave the course of carnage in my mind as a host of hooded associates gather around me from dark corners and lofty rafters. We are the blood-red threads that will criss and cross this throne room.We are the Spider\u2019s spinnerets\u2014a latticework of slaughter sent to end a dynasty. I dance to my delight, knowing the red rain is about to fall. (To be continued...)  Written by Edwin McRae and Rachel Rees.Directed by Robbie. Illus. by Sam Yang.",

        "(Written by Nicola Price, edited by Tarryn Thomas, illustrated by Sam Yang.) The trade route wound between the rolling hills, a path of dirt and clay moulded by the passage of the centuries. Dark shadows enfolded the dim landscape, and the beaten path was cast in shades of violet and listless green as the sun sank behind the horizon, relinquishing the stage to a foreboding twilight. Golden armour gleamed faintly in the last few traces of sunlight, quietly announcing the arrival of a small party of knights, marching along the trail to the north. Boltyn\u2019s gaze was locked firmly on the fields ahead, scanning the skyline for signs of any other travellers. Behind him, the rest of his party strode forward, their hands resting on their weapons, eyes flicking from side to side as they scoured the gloomy landscape for potential threats. Months of hunting down cultists in the Northern Realms had left each of them changed by the weight of duty; their shoulders were taut with silent tension, their weapons at the ready, their gazes ever-moving, constantly checking their surroundings for the slightest trace of shadow aether.   A plume of dark smoke rose from the skyline, rancid with the acrid stench of burning flesh. As they drew closer, Boltyn began to taste the sour-sweet coating of its soot on the back of his tongue, an almost tangible layer of fine ash carried by the evening breeze. \u201cBoltyn\u2014\u201d \u201cI see it.\u201d Boltyn exchanged a glance with Leander, their expressions a mirrored image of dread and determination. Even at this distance, both of them could feel the faint tremor of the Shadow, while the fading daylight was snuffed out by the dusk which bloomed along the horizon. Its presence seeped into their veins like the bone-deep cold of freshly fallen snow, leaving their fingertips pale beneath the beaten metal of their gauntlets. Just beyond the fields, a crimson glow loomed within the growing darkness: rising flames revealed silhouettes encircling the open fire. Boltyn gestured toward the horizon with two fingers, listening to the muffled sounds of his party fanning out behind him, their weapons at the ready. As one, they crept closer to the group of cultists who stood in the distance, painfully aware of each and every sound which seemed to echo through the thick silence. Muffled whimpers greeted them as the party drew within earshot. Boltyn\u2019s attentive gaze swept over the figures gathered in the centre of the circle: Amidst the ring of shrouded cultists, a group of bound captives knelt uncomfortably close to the flames. Their faces were drawn with terror, and bloodied marks were scattered across their ashen skin. They swayed slightly on their knees, exhaustion written plainly in every line of their bodies, their eyelids drooping closed even as the cultists chanted to draw upon the dwindling energy of their unwilling sacrifices. Boltyn swung his sword clear of its sheath, signalling the rest of his squad forward as he charged toward the cultists. Their expressions faltered for only a moment as the band of knights raced into the light of the fire, leaping into the fray. As one, the cultists raised their hands overhead, breaking into a haunting, grating chant which shattered the hushed erstwhile quiet of their ritual. The party of knights burst through the circle like a tidal wave, weapons brandished high as they fought their way toward the group of captives. Two of the inquisitors broke off, falling to their knees next to the villagers and quickly beginning to cut through their bindings, their fellow knights all that stood between them and the forces of the Shadows. Boltyn and his fellow inquisitors acted as their shield, deflecting the onslaught of arcane attacks and fighting to keep the cultists at bay. With each passing moment, the cultists\u2019 power only seemed to grow, shadow aether flooding the cool air as the circle drew upon the might of the beyond. Suddenly, with a sharp cry, the inquisitor to Boltyn\u2019s right fell to his knees, head bowed as he slowly slumped to the ground. Viator\u2019s face was pallid, the colour draining from his skin until he resembled the ashes which coated the earth beneath his feet. He lay still, barely breathing, as if the life had been drained from his very bones. As the last captive stumbled free of her bindings, Boltyn barked out an order to the rest of the party, watching out of the corner of his eye as another knight quickly propped up Viator, wrapping his arm around her shoulders. \u201cGet them to safety, now! I\u2019ll hold them off.\u201d Glancing to one side, he met the determined gaze of Leander, his second-in-command, whose steely eyes were unyielding beneath the weight of Boltyn\u2019s stare. After a moment, they shared a nod, manoeuvering themselves so that they stood back-to-back, facing down the cultists together. A series of arcane blasts fired in quick succession, shattering the split-second ceasefire, almost driving Boltyn to his knees with their raw, tangible power. The air crackled like the sky before a thunderstorm, filled with energy and charged with a devastating potential. He swung his blade in a wide arc, trying to absorb some of the blow with the edge of his sword. Runes burst to life above their heads with a bright flare of energy, blazing brightly against the darkened sky. With each rune that appeared, Boltyn felt dread pool in the pit of his stomach. At his back, Boltyn heard the quiet hiss of Leander cursing under his breath, and knew that his friend had come to the same conclusion. \u201cGo,\u201d Boltyn barked over his shoulder, swinging at the nearest cultist with his blade, tearing through the man\u2019s shoulder. \u201cGet out of here and help the others.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t fight them alone,\u201d Leander shot back, and while Boltyn couldn\u2019t see his face, he could practically sense his friend\u2019s expression\u2014teeth gritted, eyes narrowed to slits. \u201cWe can\u2019t fight them off together, either!\u201d One of the cultists finally fell to the earth, blood pooling from the wound on his side, but the rest kept on fighting. Boltyn watched with bated breath as the man he\u2019d just wounded summoned yet another attack, seemingly oblivious to the gash in his arm. \u201cLeander, go!\u201d Before his eyes, the wound appeared to slowly shrink and curl in on itself, blood evaporating into thin air, and moments later, the gash had disappeared together. Boltyn shuddered at the feeling of shadow aether washing over him, unfamiliar and deeply unsettling. As it dissipated off the edges of his armour, he felt his heart lurch in its direction, his hair standing on end at the hungry, searching sensation, not unlike the gaze of a predator hunting its next meal. Behind him, Boltyn heard the sharp clatter of metal against the ground, and turned his head to see Leander\u2019s twin blades tumbling to the earth. The inquisitor himself slowly slumped to his knees, visibly trembling. Boltyn quickly manoeuvred himself between Leander and the cultists. Out of the corner of his eye, he noted Leander\u2019s face, stark white, his expression twisted with a mixture of pain and exertion, beads of sweat collecting on his brow as he fought to stay upright. Traces of shadow aether curled off the sides of his armour, a fine mist that was coiling through the air towards the cultists surrounding them both. While Leander grew weaker, fighting against the pull of unconsciousness, their foes only seemed to grow stronger, their attacks coming faster and faster. Standing alone, outnumbered, outmatched, and overwhelmed, Boltyn steeled himself, turning aside the dread which pooled in the pit of his stomach. He filled his mind with the memory of Aios, so young, and yet fearless even amidst the devastation of the attack on Solana. Boltyn\u2019s determination coursed through his veins. A blazing heat which felt both fiercely protective and achingly familiar, as gentle and welcoming as a patch of warm sunlight in the dead of winter, it was yet as powerful and untamed as a forest fire. Bellona\u2019s light washed over him, and for a moment Boltyn saw nothing but the shape of her wings, flaring in the dark. The shadows around him dissipated, and the arcane attacks dispersed into fine mist, shattered by the radiant shield which had formed around Boltyn. Rays of light burst forward from his blade, spearing the cultists\u2019 arcane attacks before they had a chance to fully form. The cultists, who had turned their attention to Leander, collapsed to the earth, their parasitic connection suddenly bursting with light. It had sent them to their knees, trembling from the force of the intangible blow.    Seized by this unknown power, Boltyn charged at the semi-circle of cultists around him, striking each of them down one by one, his armour gleaming like the first light of dawn. He moved as if guided by some ancient, unknowable force, fighting with a preternatural speed and grace. As the last foe fell to the ground, Boltyn rose to his full height, slowly sheathing his sword. Leander slowly forced himself into a sitting position, his disbelieving gaze fixed firmly on the rigid, tense line of Boltyn\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI didn't know you could do that,\u201d Leander murmured, as if raising his voice a single octave higher would shatter some unspoken rule. After a long moment, Boltyn turned to gaze down at his friend, his eyebrows furrowed. \u201cNeither did I,\u201d he finally admitted, turning his gaze to his own hands, and analysing them as if he\u2019d never seen them before in his life.   Once the freed villagers had been safely returned to their homes, Boltyn\u2019s party received a message from the city, calling them back to Solana. Stepping through the city streets, it was almost impossible to hear the soft whispers of war. Some spoke of the fighting taking place in the golden fields, others spoke of dark omens visible on the horizon, but most referred to the attack on the city, their faith shaken by the sudden, horrifying assault. While the rest of Boltyn\u2019s party dissipated into the crowd, seeking out loved ones or heading back to their houses to rest, Boltyn found himself standing before the main doors of the Library of Illumination. He remembered the young woman he\u2019d met within, recalling the sound of her voice as she recounted the tales of the Heralds; the devotion and joy with which she described each of them in all their glory and splendour. Bellona\u2019s image once again flared within his mind\u2019s eye, her blazing wings bright against the evening sky. As much as he wished to return home and greet Aios, his mind refused to be at ease. At this hour, the Library was almost completely empty; most of its daily patrons having been chased away by the lengthening shadows of dusk. The usual hushed whispers had given way to a heavy blanket of silence, betraying the age of the tomes which lined the library\u2019s shelves. As Boltyn moved down the hallway, he made a concerted effort to quiet his footsteps, conscious of the armoured travelling boots he had yet to remove. As if summoned, Prism suddenly emerged from one of the aisles ahead, turning towards him with a cheerful, unguarded smile.   \u201cBoltyn, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Her voice, while bright and filled with life, was still soft enough to avoid disturbing the still library, complimenting rather than breaking the heavy silence. Boltyn nodded in response, though she hardly needed the confirmation - he found it difficult to imagine Prism forgetting anything. She seemed like the type of person whose mind resembled a steel snare; once it clamped shut on a new piece of information, it held strong. \u201cYes. Actually, I was hoping to run into you.\u201d Prism\u2019s expression visibly brightened, curiosity washing over her face. \u201cOh? Why? Did you have more questions about the Heralds?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d He wasn\u2019t entirely sure whether or not that had been an educated guess on her part, as Boltyn\u2019s only real conversation with her had been about the Heralds. But perhaps the young scholar had somehow seen the answer within his mind. For some reason, the latter explanation didn\u2019t seem so far-fetched. \u201cSomething\u2026 strange\u2026 happened while I was outside Solana.\u201d \u201cYou were sent outside the city gates? You have become an Inquisitor, right? Oh, I\u2019d love it if you could tell me about your journeys\u2014what you\u2019ve seen, the things you\u2019ve done\u2026\u201d \u201cWell - I believe I may have seen Bellona.\u201d As he\u2019d expected, Prism\u2019s gaze immediately snapped back to meet his, her expression flooded with a series of different emotions in very quick succession, none of which lasted long enough for Boltyn to decipher what he\u2019d seen. \u201cMy party fought a group of cultists in the Northern realms. They\u2019d captured some nearby villagers to sacrifice as part of a ritual, and once we had freed them from their bindings, I told the rest of my party to get them to safety. My second-in-command and I remained to fight off the cultists, and hopefully to give the others time to escape.\u201d Boltyn paused for a moment, eyebrows furrowed as he drew the memories to the surface. \u201cAll of the cultists had aether affinity, and could cast runes and spells. Some of them were using the Shadow aether in order to drain energy from my second, Leander, who quickly became too weak to fight and collapsed to the ground. I remember standing between him and the cultists, trying to find a way to prevent them from killing him, or chasing after our party and the villagers they were leading to freedom. And then, just as I thought I was going to die in that circle\u2014\u201d \u201cYou saw Bellona,\u201d Prism guessed, a quiet, unshakeable certainty ringing through her soft voice. \u201cI felt determined, and then very warm\u2014as if I were standing in front of an open fire. It was familiar, but also simultaneously the strangest feeling I\u2019ve ever experienced. I felt as though I had recognised an old friend, someone whom I had not seen in a very long time, and yet reconnected with almost instantly. And then\u2014suddenly everything seemed so much brighter. My sword turned white-hot in my hands, light burst forth from the blade, and the unnatural shadows began to dissipate. Their arcane attacks just glanced off my armour, and then vanished altogether. The moment that their spells began to fail, I just charged forward and immediately went on the offensive. I\u2019ve never felt like that before, but at the time, it felt so natural. Like I\u2019d done it before.\u201d \u201cAs if you somehow just knew, deep inside your soul, what to do. You called the light, and it answered so quickly and readily that you thought you must have done it before.\u201d \u201cYes, exactly.\u201d Prism broke into a wide grin, her gaze filled with a glaring focus Boltyn hadn\u2019t seen before. \u201cI believe I know exactly what happened. Tell me, how much do you know about Solana and the Demonastery?\u201d She led him toward the back of the Library, directing him toward a stained glass window that Boltyn had never taken note of before. The stained glass appeared as though it were made of gold and amber, trapping the light of the sun in a prismatic form. Within the swirls and patterns, Boltyn could make out the markings of the Heralds, somehow recognising them despite never having seen them before. His gaze was immediately drawn to Bellona\u2019s; a blade of blazing light which filled his soul with warmth. \u201cOnly a little. I\u2019m not sure what you teach young Solanians who aren\u2019t chosen for the Light of Sol, but I don\u2019t know much of the city\u2019s history.\u201d \u201cThen let me start from the beginning.\u201d Prism cleared her throat, her face settling into a detached, peaceful expression, and Boltyn was suddenly hit by a sharp bolt of familiarity. For a moment, he saw his grandmother\u2019s face, felt the press of her arm around his small shoulders, pulling him close as she cleared her throat, preparing to tell him yet another story.   \u201cSolana has long existed in the land of Rathe. Our forefathers came to this land a long time ago, and were guided by Sol\u2019s grace to the earth on which we now stand. Here, they began to build the city of Solana. Our people have always been filled with a kind of curiosity, which drives us to understand the world in which we live. In time, as the village grew into a proper city, our people began to separate into different roles. Some of them became scholars, and as they were the most learned and devoted citizens of Solana, they eventually came to lead our people. \u201cHowever, not all intelligent minds are made for leadership, and not all devotion is equal. One of our scholars, the very first to have led our people, abused his power. By day, he practiced his sacred duties to Solana, studied the teachings of Sol, and pursued the path of the Light. However, by night, he would disappear under the pretense of retiring to his bed, when in truth, he went to the room he had created as a hiding place for all of Rathe\u2019s secrets. In the darkness he followed the broken path: He studied the ways of Shadow.   \u201cIn time, the Apostate\u2019s betrayal was revealed to the rest of the city, and the scholars of Solana sought to bring an end to his dangerous, heinous studies. Yet at the moment that they\u2019d learned of his actions, the Apostate fled, hiding himself first from the Light, and then from all of Rathe. Eventually, we came to learn that he had built a new home for himself, one which was devoted to the most nightmarish studies known to humankind. \u201cThe Apostate, a scholar of Solana, was the one who founded the Demonastery. It was the ultimate betrayal, a perversion of everything that Solana has stood for. The Shadow is a path of untold power, but one which always demands a high price. The followers of the broken path are unafraid to sacrifice others in their quest for power, harming the innocent and casting aside all that is good in order to pursue their own selfish desires.   \u201cThis is the truth of our fair city. Solana and the Demonastery will be forever linked through our history, and as we were the ones who created the Apostate, it is our duty to bring an end to the Demonastery. Sometimes, this fight creates great strife not only for our city, but for all of Rathe. In these times of struggle and sacrifice, Sol sometimes grants us gifts, so that we might fight back against the malicious intentions of the Demonastery. While that dark and devious place is filled with followers of the broken path, who devote themselves to pursuing the blighted magics of the Shadow, we Solanians are noble and pure of heart, devoting ourselves to the Light. With Sol\u2019s guidance, we dedicate ourselves to understanding the world around us. This knowledge, this devotion, sometimes blesses us with gifts that the rest of Rathe shall never know for themselves.\u201d With a wave of her hand, Prism created two shining visions in the air before them. In the pale lantern light, two figures took shape, almost twice Boltyn\u2019s height, their countenances immeasurably ancient, filled with a grace and wisdom which no human could possibly hope to understand. \u201cI have dedicated myself to the study of the Light, and to the quest of showing all of Rathe the blessings of Sol. I believe that my gift for illusions was guided, in part, by Suraya\u2019s hand.\u201d Prism turned to the figure who stood on their left, her face almost shining as she looked up at the Herald\u2019s shimmering form. \u201cRecently, I awakened to a power that I had never seen or read about before, and was gifted with the talents of the Light. In that moment, I glimpsed Suraya looking down upon me, and saw the shape of her hand as she reached out to me, gesturing for me to move onward. You see, I have a duty entrusted to me, and the Light shall guide me on this path to peace. You, like me, were chosen to be blessed with the most precious of Sol\u2019s gifts. Bellona has bestowed the Light talent upon you so that you might use it to drive back the shadow, and fight to protect Rathe from the horrors of the Demonastery.\u201d Prism turned back to him with a smile, her expression lined with a peace which could only come from knowledge, and a wisdom beyond her years. \u201cYou mean to tell me that this blessing, this talent, is for me to use in the coming fight?\u201d Boltyn frowned curiously, his eyebrows faintly furrowed. \u201cDoes that mean I will be able to continue using it in battle from now on?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Prism confirmed, her pale golden eyes crinkling slightly at the corners. \u201cYou will always be able to use this power, Boltyn. Once given, the blessings of Sol cannot be returned.\u201d \u201cWhy me? Why would Bellona or Sol choose to bless me with the Light?\u201d \u201cYou said that you faced a group of cultists, is that correct? That every one of them was a follower of Shadow, that they all had aether affinity, and were casting some of the more powerful and darkest spells known to Rathe.\u201d Prism smiled, shrugging one shoulder. \u201cI cannot say for certain, but if I had to guess, I would say that that is your answer. You stood against the cultists, even though you knew that you would likely lose your life. You were prepared to sacrifice yourself for Leander, for your party, and for the villagers whom you had been fighting to save. Your selflessness, your leadership, your courage, your compassion, your devotion to the virtues of the Light\u2014this is why you were chosen, Boltyn. This is why your talents awakened.\u201d Boltyn looked from Prism to the image of Bellona, her bronze mask moulded into an expression of fierce determination, blazing with the light of the sun. \u201cHow did you learn to wield it? Did it always come naturally to you?\u201d \u201cA little. It usually just feels like something that you know you\u2019ve done before, but you haven\u2019t done it in a long time. I began to learn pretty quickly, once I started practicing.\u201d At her weighted pause, Botlyn looked over to see Prism staring thoughtfully at Suraya\u2019s serene, inscrutable countenance. \u201cThe Librarian said that it\u2019s not uncommon for the Light talent to start emerging when Solana enters a time of war. I\u2019m not sure if it is Sol, or the heralds, or just simply born of our own determination. Maybe we all hold the potential, and a struggle just makes us remember.\u201d \u201cI think that if anyone could figure out what the Light talent is, and why it emerges, it would be you.\u201d Prism turned her head to smile radiantly at him, her golden eyes gleaming with determination.   In the rosy-fingered light of dawn, the Solarium was still and near-silent, a relative quiet which was broken only by the sound of soft footsteps against the earth. Almost the entire Glory of Sol was gathered within the Amphitheatre, waiting patiently for the guests of honour to arrive. At the centre, the Grand Magister walked toward the podium, raising their hands to address the crowd. \u201cToday, those of us gathered here prepare for the culmination of our efforts against the Demonastery. Today, we fight to protect all of Rathe from the horrors of the Shadow, and prevent our people from experiencing the darkness and destruction which the armies of the Demonastery have inflicted upon our beloved city. We have seen what the Demonastery is capable of, when left to pursue their dark desires. Will we stand idly by, while they sacrifice innocent lives in their quest for power?\u201d The crowd began to stir at the sound of the Grand Magister\u2019s impassioned voice, carried throughout the Amphitheatre. Boltyn felt the energy in the air shift, as the sun\u2019s light peeked over the horizon and cast the morning sky in shades of gold. \u201cWe must stand for the virtues of the Light, and defend the innocent. We must eradicate the Shadows. The Demonsatery must fall. Today, we march to meet the armies of the Demonastery, and drive back the Shadows from the world of Rathe.\u201d The Amphitheatre was flooded with wordless cries of determination, answering the Grand Magister\u2019s call to arms. As others drew their weapons, thrusting their blades toward the sky in a salute, Boltyn looked out over the crowd, and met with Prism\u2019s knowing gaze. For one single moment, in the pale light, Boltyn thought he glimpsed Bellona\u2019s figure, too; rising above the Solarium, her fiery wings painting the sky in brilliant shades of gold and amber.",
        "Magisters: The guiding light of Solana, Magisters are champions who are specially chosen to execute the will of Sol. There are eight Magisters in the city, each representing one of the eight sectors. Their ornate masks mark them as divine messengers, who have dedicated their lives to delivering the word of Sol. Each Magister is an accomplished scholar of the Light, and each is responsible for one of the city\u2019s landmarks, in addition to serving as a member of the Grand Council.",
        "Creation and destruction, an endless cycle of hope and despair. One cannot exist without the other, yet neither can they be equal, balanced. In Summer, the enlightened hours stretch like cats basking in the sunlight. In Winter, darkness curls close around our shivering flesh. Each day a battlefield as the Dusk and Dawn wax and wane.  The fighters of Solana and Aria threw back the demon horde with unified defiance, slaughtering the monstrosities until carcasses piled high across the Golden Fields. Yet still, the Demonastery spewed out an endless flow of aberration. Days of courageous defense stretched into weeks of desperate withdrawal. Despite the struggle and sacrifice, the remaining towns fell. Dorinthea held the road, her knights giving their all\u2014and their ultimate\u2014to protect the last refugees of Solana\u2019s once proud sovereignty. As the final straggler limped through the gateway, Ironsong ordered the retreat. Lightning-tipped arrows rained down from the ramparts, Lexi\u2019s rangers forming a bulwark of elemental mortality. They held the foe at bay as the remaining Rosetta, Ollin, and Hand of Sol fled behind the safety of Solana\u2019s walls. The last of the eight great gates swung closed with monumental grace. Its sealing kiss forged such a resounding peal of metal on metal that it rang like a temple bell across the city. Dorinthea looked at the people she had saved, the blood-smeared faces of parents clutching ragged children, too shocked, too exhausted to cry. Dorinthea clenched her teeth against the acid guilt that rose like bile in her throat. The Hand of Sol had vowed to protect these people, a promise in their Aesir\u2019s name, a just reward for years of worship and service. Now livelihoods were gone, homes burned, loved ones killed and consumed. They had failed. Dorinthea had failed -- again. \u201cI know that look,\u201d said Boltyn as kindly as he could, though weariness made his words sound brittle. \u201cWe held them longer than we thought. Saved more lives than we hoped.\u201d \u201cWe can thank our friends from Aria for that.\u201d \u201cYes, and we can thank Sol. We prayed and Sol answered.\u201d Dorinthea was about to answer when she noticed a twist in the gathering dusk. Like a worm, it writhed in the corner of her eye. It sent a slimy shiver down her spine. She spun and stared into the crowd. Refugees stared back, eyes bleary. She looked from gaunt faces to smooth facades, casting a sentinel\u2019s scrutiny across the surrounding buildings. Nothing to see but the straight and white - washed lines of armories and barracks, as yet untouched by war. \u201cSomething wrong?\u201d asked Boltyn. Perhaps a trick of her tired mind, born from the horrors she had witnessed. This was a sanctified city, centuries of arcane artifice etched into every brick and slate. From outer wall to inner sanctum, conduits and runes flowed and connected, flooding the streets and structures with Sol\u2019s divinity. Dorinthea shook her head. \u201cLet\u2019s find these people some food and shelter.\u201d Once, and only once, had the Demonastery manifested their foul creations within the city, exploiting a lone frailty left unnoticed over centuries of peace. Thebasto, Magister of Defense, had since eliminated that weakness. The runes were stronger than ever. No Shadow could survive within Solana\u2019s sublime architecture.   In the days to come, Solana\u2019s faith proved out as the city\u2019s runic ramparts thwarted the Demonastery\u2019s endless tide. Time and again they attacked, only to retreat, bloodied and broken, leaving ever more shattered carcasses in their wake like flotsam on a beach. Though their hearts bled for the lands and lives lost beyond the walls, Solana\u2019s champions allowed themselves to breathe, to sleep. In Sol\u2019s embrace, they were safe. At dusk on the sixth day of the siege, the attacks suddenly abated. Perhaps even the Demonastery\u2019s wanton appetite had soured over the waste of monstrous meat. That very evening, within the bright heart of the Great Library, the allies drew their plans against the besieging horde. For even the gardens of Octogria could not feed so many for long. Solana had to strike back with a mortal blow, or suffer the slow death of starvation. Shiyana\u2019s clear voice rang out through the Scholars Assembly as she spoke of the Dimenxxional Gateway -- the Demonastery\u2019s only bridge to the infinite malice of the Embra\u2019s \u00edArathael. Through substantial cost to their order, the Gemini had discovered a path to the portal and the faces of those few Shadow scholars able to control it. \u201cOur brave Gemini emissaries have brought us a gift beyond anything we might have hoped for,\u201d implored Shiyana. \u201cA way to end this war once and for all.\u201d Beside her, Prism nodded her agreement, yet it was Dorinthea who spoke. \u201cWe must go now, for Solana.\u201d She looked to Bravo and Lexi, Briar and Oldhim, and the brave folk of Aria who remained. \u201cFor all of Rathe.\u201d Behind Dorinthea\u2019s steely gaze, Minerva tumbled over and over into that inky rift on Morlock Hill. Was her friend still alive, held somewhere in the Demonastery? Was it better if she were dead? Across the hall, Boltyn stood and raised his hands, begging patience. \u201cWhile Dorinthea speaks true, I have seen the Gemini\u2019s reports. They have sacrificed much, yet we know little of what we shall face beyond the veil. We must prepare. We might not get a second chance.\u201d Bravo rose to his feet, wincing as his muscles pulled at the bandaged wound on his broad chest. \u201cA storm is coming, and it will shake their damned house to its very foundations. Am I right?!\u201d   The Ollin answered in thunderous agreement, an uproar of such fervor, such courage, that it tugged a smile from even Ser Boltyn\u2019s stern lips. As the noble assembly dispersed to make its preparations, another parlance was only beginning. Nestled within the entrails of the Demonastery, walled in by Shadow-born runes, the Iron Maiden addressed the Redeemed. \u201cA mere window, narrow and fragile,\u201d murmured Vynnset, her words slurred and ephemeral. Most of her mind was elsewhere, holding another conversation that only she could hear. \u201cNasreth promises nothing more.\u201d Levia regarded Vynnset with eyes of chilling violet. Her beauty belied the beast within. Her grace concealed the hunger.  \u201cIt is all I need.\u201d Vynnset looked to the trembling man at her feet, plucked from his knightly armor like a soft snail from its shell. On each side, a half dozen of his comrades mirrored his misery. Thirteen in all. Vynnset pressed the curved blade to his throat, gripping his filthy blond hair with her free hand. She whispered, sharp enough for Levia to hear over the blood sack\u2019s whimpering. \u201cApostate of the Ages,\u201d she intoned. \u201cThat which you have sewn, I shall reap. Thirteen, I give you, to honor the lives given so long ago. We remember your disciples, our Magister of Shadow, as we remember you.\u201d A howl echoed through the rafters above them as if from a gust of wind, though they were fathoms underground. The obsidian floor warmed, becoming as pliable as living ebony skin. \u201cThank you, my Lord,\u201d whispered the Iron Maiden as she drew the blade across the knight\u2019s throat. One after the other, she exsanguinated her Solanian captives. The blood had little time to pool before the fleshy floor drank it down. As the last drop dissipated, the chamber\u2019s runes flared with livid hues, turning from a bruised purple to a bright arterial red. Levia turned to the archway that dominated the zenith of the chamber, watching as it filled with a churning darkness. With neither hesitation nor doubt, she stepped into the sable embrace of the Dimenxxional Gateway. Back in Solana, as exhausted folk slumbered, their tireless defenders preparing for the bold task ahead, a boy stepped out of a doorway and onto the quiet street. He stood there for a moment, as if taking in the night air, yet his chest moved not a muscle. His face was a rictus mask in the moonlight. His eyes -- once a warm brown that could melt his mother\u2019s heart -- were now sunken into pits of shadow. \u201cCaylin? Why are you out of bed?\u201d His mother placed a hand on his bare shoulder. She gasped as her hand withered, her arm blackened. A croak escaped her desiccated throat. Bones, healthy but moments before, shattered as her corpse hit the floor. The boy walked down the street, not once looking back. Others joined him, women and men of varying ages, a couple of children. By the time they reached the wall, they numbered thirteen. Sentinels tried to block them on the steps. The thirteen scattered their chalky bones with bare, gray-veined feet. Others held their posts, greeted these roaming refugees with calm questions of concern, then sharp shouts of warning. All fell, their flesh shriveled around crumbling bones. Once the slaughter was done, the thirteen formed a half circle on the alure. They clasped hands and recited the rite that their lord and master, the Apostate, had taught them so many years ago. In that moment, those thirteen disciples, raised anew in stolen flesh, made their final vow to the woman who watched them from the battlefield below. Levia the Redeemed answered with a roar. As she surrendered her body to Blasphomet, the thirteen surrendered their souls to the Apostate. Shadow spewed forth, emptying their borrowed vessels. It poured down onto the wall, corroding the stones, drowning their hallowed runes in corruption. It swept from battlement to base like a wave of decay. \u201cA moment, fleeting at best.\u201d  Even as the wall gleamed around the darkened stain; even as light burned at the clinging gloom -- containing, cleansing -- Levia the Consumed struck the rampart with all of her primordial strength. Stones that had withstood thousands of years now splintered under that gargantuan blow. The wall gave way with an ear-shattering crack and the Consumed broke through into the sleeping city beyond. Lexi rushed out onto the barrack roof. Her breath caught in her throat as she took in the clouds of dust and smoke. Briar joined her moments later. \u201cFlow save us,\u201d she whispered as the clouds parted. Dorinthea and Boltyn rallied a vanguard of those closest at hand, warriors and illusionists of Solana rushing into the fray with the wizards and runeblades of Aria. They led them against the creatures that surged into the city around the towering Consumed. They cut through the Demonastery\u2019s slavering shock troops, buying precious moments for fleeing citizens. Yet they were too few to hold back the tide for long. Half their number fell in the first charge, more as their formation buckled under the sheer weight of the onslaught.   \u201cTo the Solarium!\u201d ordered Boltyn, the Wartune\u2019s blessings ringing in his ears. With Dorinthea at his side, Boltyn held the line until the last of the surviving allies had broken free. Oldhim and Bravo mustered their guardians, leading them toward the column of char-black dust. With shields raised, they strode against a flood of panic, terrified city-folk and bloodied fighters washing around them. \u201cLook,\u201d growled Oldhim. The two armored figures of Ser Boltyn and Dorinthea Ironsong sprinted around a corner, their once-white capes now torn rags flapping in their wake. \u201cRegroup!\u201d Dorinthea shouted. \u201cThe Solarium!\u201d Behind her, the night sprouted claws and teeth, hooves and horns. Too many horrors to count, coming in fast. \u201cShield wall!\u201d bellowed Bravo. \u201cHold the bastards back as we withdraw!\u201d He raised Anothos; felt it crackle with galvanic might in his white-knuckled hands; its weight more reassuring than he would ever dare to admit. Up on the Great Library\u2019s highest balcony, Shiyana shook her head; a small act of denial beyond thought or reason. \u201cHow?\u201d The stricken scholar beside her could not answer, unable to drag her focus from her strife-torn city. A thousand stories screamed in her mind, a thousand reasons Sol could never let this happen.  Were they forsaken? Tears streamed from Prism's eyes, for only they told the truth.

        "(Written by Kasharn Rao and Edwin McRae, Illus. by Nikolay Moskvin) The setting sun casts Morlock Hill in a bloody hue. Soldiers hide amongst the wizened bushes, waiting with bated breath. Their leader, armor glinting in the fading light, points up at the hill\u2019s peak. Upon that ragged summit, a rift shimmers with foul radiance. Unworldly creatures spill forth from the portal like maggots from a rotting wound. The leader signals to their soldiers to hold. For several taught seconds, Morlock Hill is eerily quiet. The leader shatters that silence with a barked order that sends the soldiers charging up the hill. Their swords cleave through monster after monster, felling the first wave in moments. At the fore, armor splattered with gore, the leader catches their breath. It is the briefest respite. Through the seething mass of monstrosity comes a sight that sets the leader\u2019s heart hammering. A cluster of towering fiends thunder forwards, crushing lesser creatures under hoof. Their battle-axes burn with sigils and fire flares in their nostrils. The closest fiend shrieks with manic glee and swings its ax at the leader. The warrior rolls to the side, escaping the bisecting blow by a hair\u2019s breadth. Yet before they find their feet, the beast has wrenched their weapon from the ground and whipped it upwards, catching the leader\u2019s helm with the tip of its blade. The helm goes flying, unleashing a cascade of golden locks. Dorinthea spits blood and braces herself for the next attack. The creature barges forward, but this time Dorinthea slides low, passing beneath the ax\u2019s arc. She leaps to her feet, and as the fiend turns to face her, she sweeps her Dawnblade through its thick neck. The horned head thuds into the dirt, souring the earth with its blood. Her victory is fleeting. Dorinthea spins to meet her next foe, and the blood drains from her face at the sight of three looming demons, larger again than the fiend she has felled. Hope falters, guttering like a candle in the wind.   Solana, plunged into shadow by the endless hordes brought forth by the Demonastery. Fardreyas was the first village to be consumed. Then Sunvale, Audra, and Hazeltown. Solana\u2019s farmlands and crops burned to ash, animals slaughtered. So far Ser Boltyn and his vanguard have held the walls of the city itself, but not without dire losses. Unlike the Demonastery\u2019s soulless army, Solana\u2019s people are not expendable. Every soldier, farmer, scholar, and child killed is a name remembered. A family broken.   Screams pierce Dorinthea\u2019s ears as creatures rend and devour her soldiers. She raises Dawnblade. Though her heart pounds with terror, her sword hands are steady. Though death looms over her, she will meet it with mettle. As the first giant raises its sword, something flashes between them. Weapons crash to the ground, still clutched by dismembered claws. \u201cI cannot leave you alone for one moment, can I?\u201d Minerva\u2019s scarlet hair flows over her shoulders, brighter than the demon blood she flicks from her twin blades. Her expression is grim and determined, weathered by violent experience. A smile cracks through the drying blood on Dorinthea\u2019s face. \u201cWhat kept you?\u201d Together, they rush at the fiends. Minerva goes low, aiming for knees. Dorinthea strikes high, Dawnblade slicing through muscle like a knife through sun-softened butter. The giants topple to the ground, dead before their hulking carcasses hit the dirt. The pair blaze on through the horde, cutting a path, rallying their surviving soldiers. Dorinthea leads the onslaught, hope rekindled by the flame-haired warrior at her side. They advance with intent. To clear the battlefield, to capture the rift. To reach the Demonastery and destroy its illicit power, or die in the attempt.   Solana\u2019s shrewdest scholars pored over their tomes and devices, its keenest scouts scoured the shadows, until at last they found the source of the Demonastery\u2019s abyssal army. The Vitiate Gateway, the last of nine portals linking Rathe to i\u2019Arathael. During the Third Age, the Ancients believed they had destroyed the Gateways, forever banishing the realm of dreams. Hidden behind a veil of lies and illusion by an envoy of i\u2019Arathael, the ninth portal remained intact and sealed. There it remained, closed and forgotten for thousands of years, until now. Able to slip through the fabric of space, the Demonastery carries the Vitiate Gateway with it, using rifts to disgorge their hordes wherever they please. Yet these rifts flow both ways. And with most of the Demonastery\u2019s legion focused on the breakpoint near Solana, other rifts lie neglected, guarded lightly by unwitting demons. What better defense than a courageous offense upon the enemy\u2019s own doorstep?   The last horned head thumps into the blood-drenched earth. The hill is theirs, but for how long? \u201cWe need to fall back. More will come, and we cannot afford to lose anyone else.\u201d Dorinthea doesn\u2019t reply, instead fixing Minerva with a steely gaze that brooks no argument. Minerva levels her sword at the rift. \u201cLook!\u201d she pleads, as the next wave of horror spills out. \u201cWe need to regroup with Boltyn\u2019s vanguard, defend our people upon the walls of Solana.\u201d \u201cWe may never get another chance. We must push on.\u201d \u201cYour stubbornness will get us killed.\u201d Minerva\u2019s eyes belie her frustration, for they shine with pride. \u201cFine. What is your plan?\u201d \u201cForm up!\u201d Dorinthea orders her soldiers. \u201cFlying wedge!\u201d With Minerva at her side, her brave few at her back, Dorinthea pierces the mustering horde with her V formation. Blades flash, blood spills, demons howl and die, until the soldiers of Solana stand before the rift. A swirling chaos of dark energy and darker intent greets them from within. From that maelstrom steps a hooded figure, his skin ashen, his smile cruel. He brandishes his grimoire and draws grotesque symbols in the air with his skeletal hand. His voice is a graveyard whisper, his words ancient and forbidden. Solanian souls recoil as dismembered demons reform and rise. Bones crack back into place. Grevious wounds are sewn closed. An army is remade before their horrified eyes. Dorinthea charges forward, but before she can take but a few steps, the ground sprouts a forest of rotted arms that wrap around her legs, fixing her in place. Dawnblade is wrenched from her grasp and cast aside. While she struggles to free herself, teeth and tentacles tear her allies apart. Even Minerva struggles against the writhing mass. The hooded one bears down on Dorinthea, his gait a stiff and twitching union of magic and rigor mortis. His smiling mouth creaks open to speak his words of doom. Yet the only utterance is a rasp of surprise. As he swirls, Dorinthea can see Minerva\u2019s blade buried hilt-deep in his back. Minerva twirls her remaining sword, her will steeled against the many wounds she has suffered. With a growl, the figure wrenches the sword from his back and gestures for his creatures to keep their distance. His mouth opens, jaw cracking wider than living flesh could allow, and from that gaping maw pours a cloud of ephemeral corruption. Tendrils form, reaching and jabbing at the gaps in Minerva\u2019s armor. She carves through them with her sword, slicing her way closer, maneuvering for a killing blow. As she draws within striking distance, the hooded one\u2019s chest ruptures open. His ribs part and grow, extending out to trap the assailing warrior. Minerva doesn\u2019t struggle. Her escape is futile. Instead, she casts one last look at Dorinthea. There\u2019s no fear in her eyes. Only acceptance. The hooded one laughs, a sound like shattering bone, and tosses Minerva into the inky rift. Dorinthea\u2019s sorrow burns, her thoughts seared from her mind by white-hot fury. There\u2019s a flash like a lightning strike and her cadaverous restraints melt away. Her foes cower as she looks upon them, eyes now crackling and bright, hair shimmering with holy radiance. She reaches out with her sword hand and summons Dawnblade to her grasp. The hooded one reels from her splendor, croaking desperately for his creatures to attack. They obey, only to be destroyed by Dorinthea\u2019s incandescent rage. Bolts of foul energy leap from the hooded one\u2019s hands only to shatter harmlessly against Dorinthea\u2019s Bladehold armor. His reaching ribs snap like dry twigs beneath Dawnblade\u2019s blurring strikes. With nothing left standing between her and her quarry, Dorinthea roars as she thrusts her sword through the hooded one\u2019s silent heart. Dorinthea turns to the rift, bracing herself to enter. A guttural retching at her feet stops her. Corruption shrouds the body of the hooded one as it coughs the morbidity from its fetid lungs. With a rictus grin, it twitches and jerks across the torn earth and into the portal. The Vitiate Gateway shuts like a giant eye, then is gone. Dorinthea stands alone on Morlock Hill, her body drenched in blood, her soul wretched with loss. Minerva. Her soldiers. As the light departs, the weight of reality settles upon her weary shoulders. She is radiant no more. She is defeated.   In the scorched woods, there lies a small encampment. Beyond that, once-golden wheat fields now blackened and bare, green meadows churned to mud and littered with bloated carcasses. In the distance, plumes of smoke climb the sky from their battered city. Dorinthea and Boltyn survey the dismal scene. Proud Solana has been brought to its knees. \u201cOur flanks are safe for now. Rifts closed. The Demonastery is putting everything into its main horde.\u201d Dorinthea doesn\u2019t answer Boltyn, her words as scarred and trampled as the fields before her. \u201cIt is hard to see the light of Solana in these dark days. One of Blasmophet\u2019s followers\u2026 She ate most of my vanguard. We do not have the strength to withstand another onslaught.\u201d When she finally speaks, her voice is quiet, like a dagger to the gut. \u201cWe have to stop them.\u201d \u201cWe will. But not on our own. The Grand Magister has sent envoys to the far corners of Rathe. We need allies.\u201d \u201cThey will not help the helpless.\u201d \u201cWe might have been beaten, but we are far from helpless.\u201d \u201cThen we muster what strength remains to us. If we wish the Kingdoms of old to rise, we must show that we are worthy.\u201d Dorinthea brushes back her silver hair and stands. \u201cWe shall be the rallying cry for all of Rathe, for only together can we survive.\u201d",

        "Metrix. A metropolis of imagination. A place where ambition meets innovation and lives are reinvented every single day. In our pioneering past, we welcomed those ready to flee the traditions and oppressions of arcane Rathe. Together we built a city where fortunes could be made from the sweat of one's brow and the steam of one's machinery. Metrix has come a long way from those boilerplate beginnings. Technology has advanced in leaps and bounds, drawing a new generation of hopefuls to its bright lights, to promises writ large in glaring neon:Become more than you are.Become more than human! One young man understood these promises better than most. Yes, it is true what they say about Jules Teklovossen. He was obsessed with power, but not the paltry, petty power of politics. He was driven by the power of energy. For he knew that, with enough energy, one can do anything that the human mind can conceive of. One can even remake the world. It was in a mothballed corner of the corroding Plumvex Pipes factory, Jules Teklovossen created the elegant coils and squat battery that would forever change the course of Metrix history. The potency hissed and spat between those coils, writhing like a netted serpent striving to reach the great blue sea. But Teklovossen would not let it free. Instead, he shackled that titanic beast in a two-by-two box. A little treasure chest bursting with enough power to vitalize hundreds of homes, shops and factories. What did we call this breakthrough invention? \u201cTeklatic Dynamism,\u201d after the boy genius who cracked the secret of the coils. And do you know what Teklovossen said once he had doffed his protective eyeglasses? Once he looked upon his creation, this wonder that promised to lift us from the obscuring steam of our industrialist past? \u201cEat your clockwork heart out, Cogwerx. There\u2019s a new power in town.\u201d Excerpt from: The Dynamic Man Suspended trams slice through the steam fog on teklatic rails overhead. A few blocks away, currents of dynamism transmute helium into plasma at an unprecedented speed, fueling the great Gigadrill Elevator as it pounds out tenatan for the miners who scurry up and down the sheer cliffs of Pit 3. The Needle towers over the site office, jagged and patchworked in its unfinished form. It reaches for the clouds with aspiring grace, as if to pin the Teklo Industries brand upon the very fabric of history. A new headquarters to usher in a fresh era for Metrix. Jules Teklovossen stands at the epicenter, the Evos he wears automatically steadying his swaying frame as another dizzy spell catches him off-guard. \u201cThat thing will give anyone vertigo,\u201d says the Assembly Inspector as he enters the site. \u201cJoking aside though, are you alright, Professor?\u201d The man sounds genuinely concerned, but Teklovossen can tell from the official\u2019s body language that it\u2019s feigned. \u201cThe sight of it makes me giddy,\u201d he covers. Maybe his bad habits are catching up with him. Over three decades of long hours in the laboratory, of living only for the work. No family. No recreation. Barely enough time spared to sleep and eat. A life devoted to the founding and building of Teklo Industries. A passion committed to progress. The Assembly Inspector grins in response, another feigned gesture, then turns on his heels to scan the construction. \u201cI need to sign off on your amendments to the upper floor plans,\u201d he says in an appraising tone. \u201cOf course.\u201d Teklovossen directs his voice to the prefab office nearby. \u201cRigo?\u201d The spider-bot assistant scuttles out of the prefab office with Teklovossen\u2019s blueprints clutched in its claws. Teklovossen takes the proffered plans and spreads them on the workbench. The inspector eyes the bot warily, taking in its many articulated legs and swiveling eye cameras; the bulbous micro-processor bracketed to its back. \u201cQuite the antique you have there,\u201d he remarks. Teklovossen absently pats the bot on its spherical appendage, like a father might pat his son on the head. \u201cRigo\u2019s been with me since the very beginning.\u201d \u201cIt was there when you invented teklatic-dynamism?\u201d \u201cYes, among others that I built for the purpose.\u201d The inspector peers more closely at Rigo. \u201cClockwork and compressed steam? Thought that was more Cogwerx\u2019s style.\u201d \u201cIf it works, it works. I\u2019m not one to shun technology that has survived the tests of time.\u201d \u201cThat explains the boilers in your basement.\u201d He raises a bushy eyebrow. \u201cForgive me for saying so, but doesn\u2019t that send the wrong message?\u201d Teklovossen manages an indulgent smile. \u201cTeklatic-dynamism is potential incarnate, yet energies of this world fluctuate, attenuate, constellate, in patterns far beyond our mundane comprehension.\u201d The inspector looks at him, uncomprehending. \u201cIt never hurts to have a reliable backup.\u201d \"Can\u2019t argue with that, Professor.\u201d The inspector returns to the building plans before him, trying his bureaucratic best to poke holes in Teklovossen\u2019s dream. \u201cTheoretically sound,\u201d he reluctantly concedes. \u201cI have no idea how you\u2019re actually managing it.\u201d He points at Rigo. \u201cMore of these?\u201d \u201cAfter a fashion.\u201d The inspector\u2019s brown eyes take on an almost lustful gleam. \u201cI really would like to meet your builders.\u201d Teklovossen rubs the pad of his thumb across his mustache and smiles at Rigo. The spider-bot nods his misshapen head in agreement. \u201cQuite impossible, Inspector,\u201d answers Teklovossen, \u201cfor what is creativity without a little mystery?\u201d The sphere spins between his metallic palms, its galvanic potential reflected off the polished carapaces and chassis of the dismembered dolls that litter the old Plumvex workshop. \u201cYou\u2019ll do,\u201d admires Teklovossen. He glances across the limbs, busts and heads of humanoid automatons towards rows of spheres, each of a similar likeness, arranged along padded shelves. Every egg contains a yolk of intelligence, each more golden than the last. Brighter minds than most humans he has met. Yet all have fallen short. Too specialized. Brilliant at some things, dull at others. And not an ounce of invention among them. Brains for clever bots of brass and bolts, nothing more. With his free hand, he presses at the temple of a copper cranium on his bench. The back of its skull opens to reveal a concave socket of glowing contacts. He places the sphere gently inside. This one is different. A wild experiment. Possibilities unknown, packed into this perfect micro-processor. \u201cYou\u2019ll do rather nicely.\u201d He heaves a shuddering sigh of relief. Already he can feel the thought-choking fog rolling in, the emptying exhaustion that will leave him bedridden for the rest of the day. Perhaps the week. A tumor, inoperable. Nestled like a fat leech against his cortex, sucking away his vitality, his genius. So much to do, yet so little time remaining to him. His intellect has never failed him. His ideas will live on, undying, while there are minds to remember them. But will he live to see those ideas come to fruition? Teklovossen can predict many things, but not that. \u201cSee that the Iron Assembly installs it properly, Rigo?\u201d Rigo whirs and bleeps. Its enthusiasm is echoed by another bot that scuttles out from behind a pile of brass mannequin parts. And other, lowering itself from the rafters by a high tensile wire. The chorus continues as bots of all shapes and sizes, intents and purposes, crawl, roll, scuttle and slide out of the workshop\u2019s nooks and crannies to witness Teklovossen\u2019s crowning invention.   The ailing scientist manages a sickly smile for his automaton audience as he cups the skull in his hands and presses its temples with his thumbs. The cranium closes smoothly, concealing the sphere within. \u201cIt will be the brains of their operation. Their sensory network. Their nervous system.\u201d He holds the skull up to his face. Glass eyes stare back. Its strangely coiffed pate gives it a jaunty appearance. \u201cAll that this city lives and feels shall be parsed and interpreted in elegant autometry.\u201d Rigo scuttles forward and gently takes the copper head from Teklovossen\u2019s hands. \u201cThank you, Rigo. May their gratitude to Teklo Industries survive the company\u2019s founder.\u201d He turns to his console, taps out a code and hits the execute key. Symbols spray across the screen. He reads quickly, despite the bleary film coating his stinging eyes. \u201cThe Biochic hardware appears to have done the trick. Much better than that Medreach rubbish. The teklatic generator has achieved perpetuity and the thermal readings are within sustainable parameters, although the variance might take time to stabilize. A good thing I had those backup boilers serviced. Wouldn\u2019t you all agree?\u201d His bots answer with an ensemble of synthesized amity. Music to Teklovossen\u2019s ears. He looks out through the workshop window at The Needle glowing gold in the afternoon light. Bright and beautiful\u2014a tribute to ideas made manifest. He turns back to his console and stumbles through a series of short commands. The execute key echoes with a hollow finality. \u201cAnalysis filters are in place and attuned to key performance indicators. You\u2019ll check on them from time to time, won\u2019t you, Rigo?\u201d His oldest and most faithful creation bobs its head in abject acknowledgement. \u201cGood. Metrix produces a boggling amount of inconsequential data. Yet if distilled correctly, patiently, the key performance indicators should emerge from the dross.\u201d He lets out a world-weary sigh. \u201cThe city has a long way to go, but it might yet prove itself worthy. In fact...\u201d A gleaming metropolis enters his mind\u2019s eye. Towers and tramways shining with teklatic-dynamism. Prosperous people strolling along clean streets, no matter their walk of life. They breathe pristine air, chat about creativity and philosophy while bots do their work and Evos sustain their bodies. A Metrix happy in its achievements. A utopia just out of reach. \u201c...I\u2019m counting on it.\u201d He yawns, then winces at the sharp pain the movement induces behind his eyes. \u201cGo now, Rigo. Give this brain unto its body corporate. Head straight to your charging station, and most importantly, don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d He smiles at his automatons, his gaze lingering upon his lifelong companion. \u201cI\u2019m just going to have a little lie down.\u201d Metrix, a city of imagination. A city where one can become more than human. Such is the case of Jules Teklovossen. No one knows what caused the explosion. Fire crews worked through the night to douse the inferno, yet still the old Plumvex Pipes factory was utterly consumed. No one could have survived that blaze, not even the building\u2019s owner and sole living occupant. An effigy has now been installed upon the site: a bold and brilliant likeness cast in holographic bronze. Teklovossen, the man, might have left Metrix for good. But Teklovossen, the legend, will remain with us forever, instructing and inspiring the brightest minds to come.   Excerpt from: The Dynamic Man",

        "For eons, the realm of Aria has remained untouched by the passage of time. Far removed from the chaos and struggles that enveloped the rest of Rathe, its beautiful flora and fauna are as vibrant and welcoming as the diverse people that live here. Great mountain ranges glitter with ice and snow, as fast forests of green and gold stretch out far into the distance, teeming with life. But it wasn\u2019t always this way. There\u2019s few that can recall the horrors of the Third Age, before this Age of Man. A time when humanity stood alongside mighty Ancients against the Aesirs to defend this shattered world, locked in great wars that had raged since the beginning of time. These tales had been lost throughout the ages, left only in whispers of fables and legends, but the touch of the defenders and their allies can still be felt throughout Aria. Their essence and their power linger to this day; from imposing fortresses and breath-taking vistas, to the strands of the Flow comprised of the Ancients\u2019 elemental essence, to the natural and magical defences that shield Aria from the outside world, the grandeur and history of the defenders and their allies live on. A mighty citadel that overlooks the only passage into Aria, Isenloft stands proudly amidst the Isen Ranges that separate western Aria from the rest of Rathe. Once the stronghold of the Order of Ollin, Isenloft was the first line of defence against the legions of the void. The element of Ice and Earth converge here in a breath-taking spectacle, as the mighty mountains stretch up into the heavens against the harsh gales at the heart of Mt. Isen. At the end of the Third Age, Isenloft was frozen by a tremendous burst of Elemental energy. Its existence has since been forgotten by the people of Aria, until recent times when the ice that had enveloped it for centuries begins to melt, and the Ollin awaken once more.    It's said that when the Ancient of Lightning and Ice, Yvor, fell in the defence of its people, its body drifted up into the heavens and formed the isles of Enion. Floating high above the skies to the north of Isenloft, powerful streaks of Lightning flow through its skies, as the essence of Lightning and Ice converge here in a violent fashion. The people of Volthaven wandered here by accident, not too long ago, and fell in love with its breath-taking views and the boundless energy that dances through its skies. They founded Volthaven upon one of these isles, and with the help of skilled wayfarers and wise shamans, carefully guide their beloved island home as they drift slowly through Enion.    Deep within the woods, to the east of Korshem, lie the secretive grove of Candlehold. The essence of Earth and Lightning is strong here, converging into a potent elemental energy called the Strale which is aggressive and volatile, unlike the soft and gentle Flow that permeates the rest of Aria. The Queen of Candlehold sits atop a throne of elderwood as her mind wanders to the time of the Ancients. Her people, once mighty defenders, has fallen from grace after the fall of the Ancient Davnir, father of the Earth. They\u2019ve been trapped within this beautiful grove for eons, bound and melded with the Strale, but a recent shift in the Flow promises new hopes and challenges, as the spell that binds them to their beloved grove begins to weaken, and the electric thorns and brambles that surround Candlehold begin to thin.      In recent years, the barriers that once concealed and protected Aria is beginning to wane. The War of the Monarchs rages on; Aesirs and their Embras stir in their slumber, their influence seeping from i\u2019Arathael into the realm of man, as the ancient defenders that lay dormant within Aria are roused by the presence of these ancient enemies, and begin to awaken and gather once more.",

Those who seek true supremacy call upon them, trading away their own knowledge, their minds and souls, their futures and their pasts, in exchange for the power of the Shadows. Making compacts with these beings is an unforgivable crime throughout most of Rathe, and those who pursue Shadow aether often face severe consequences for practicing their craft. The Demonastery is the only place in the world where the study and practice of Shadow aether is not only permitted, but encouraged.",

        "(Written by Nicola Price, edited by Tarryn Thomas, with illustrations by Nikolay Moskvin.)   Far beyond the borders of Solana lie the Northern Realms, a large expanse of land divided amongst ancient families, who rule under the watchful, detached gaze of the City of Light. Boltyn was born to nobility, raised with the knowledge that he would inherit his father\u2019s lands. Despite his exalted status, the young Boltyn was more interested in his grandmother\u2019s tales of Solana, with their noble knights, shining streets, and great library of knowledge. The small, earnest boy in time became a steadfast young man, disillusioned with the egotistical, power-hungry nobles who ruled the surrounding lands. While they were ensnared by the Shadow, delighting in their dark, vicious games, Boltyn looked upon their narcissistic obsessions and despaired. On his accession, Boltyn reluctantly took up his father\u2019s mantle, but was determined to forge a new path.   It was only a few years after his father\u2019s death that a party of honourable knights arrived in Boltyn\u2019s lands. They came to offer aid to the common folk, bringing the blessings of the Light, and news of a land where all could live free. The knight\u2019s tales of a bright and beautiful city reignited Boltyn\u2019s childhood passion for the stories of Solana, so carefully stoked by his grandmother. Inspired, he chose to leave his home behind, relinquishing his status as a lord to embark on a pilgrimage to Solana, where he could begin his life anew.   The city welcomed him as one of their own, a child of the Light returning home at long last, and Boltyn soon began his training in the Hand of Sol. Amongst their ranks he met Eirina, a cleric with dark hair and shining green eyes. Her kindness and grace enchanted him from their very first meeting, and once they had completed their training, they soon found themselves in the same party, sharing conversations between missions in the Golden Fields. Together, knight and cleric made an almost unstoppable team. They provided protection and healing to all they encountered, fighting alongside their party under the light of the sun, and spending their nights in the Golden Chariot, talking and laughing alongside their friends. Boltyn and Eirina travelled together for many years, and their partnership quickly blossomed into a devoted marriage. In time, they had a beautiful baby boy, whom they named Aios. They eagerly awaited the day of their son\u2019s Awakening ceremony, hoping that the Light would guide him into the Hand of Sol.   However, word was quickly spreading of unstoppable plagues, cataclysmic cults, and the darkest of magics in the surrounding lands, featuring abhorrent rituals which spilled the blood of innocents in exchange for raw power. Boltyn was on a mission within the Golden Fields when the enemy struck, unleashing a devastating assault on the city of Solana. As soon as he heard the news, Boltyn raced back home, but he arrived too late to save Eirina. She fell defending their people, torn to shreds by one of the Shadow beasts in its attempt to breach the inner sanctum. His only consolation was that Aios had been spared, kept safely within the Solarium while others fought bravely to defend the city. Wracked by intense grief and despair, Boltyn wandered the city in a daze. In an attempt to gather himself, he sought his old friend at the Golden Chariot, Minerva, whom he knew would understand the position he now found himself in. She knew all too well the weight of grief, and made a suggestion; as a member of the Gemini, she told him of a small group within the Hand of Sol who operated as she did, working to seek out the Shadow before they could harm the people of Solana. As an Inquisitor, he could help prevent anyone else from meeting the same fate as Eirina.   While he was growing up in the Northern Realms, Boltyn had heard rumours of the dark magics that some practiced; if anyone could figure out where to begin the search, it would be him. And yet, Boltyn hesitated. If he did accept the role of Inquisitor, he would be away from the city for months, perhaps years at a time, diving right into the heart of the Shadows, the most dangerous place for anyone to be. Aios had lost his mother; could Boltyn bring himself to deprive him of his father, too? Could he take the risk that he might fall in battle, and leave his son without a parent? Could he find the courage to look into the manifold darkness of Rathe, and not lose himself within? Could he hold true to the Light, even whilst seeing the very worst of humanity? Could he indeed set aside his grief, and dedicate himself to seeking out the Shadows, in order to dispel them? Filled with doubt, Boltyn sought out the words of the Magisters, hoping that they could bring some peace to his heavy heart. Yet upon entering the Library of Illumination, he overheard the words of a young scholar who was retelling the legends of the Heralds, legendary beings who watched over the people of Solana. Glorious and ethereal, they guided all who walked the path of the Light, guardians of both the living and the dead. Enchanted by these tales of powerful, extraordinary beings, Boltyn found himself in the grasp of a powerful vision. Bellona, the Wartune Herald, appeared before him, wings aflame, wielding a mighty sword of burnished gold. The Herald then turned her gaze to the land stretching beneath her, and they watched as it turned to ash and dust, all living beings shrivelling beneath the weight of the Shadow. As the darkness spread across the land, she lifted her sword above her, summoning the Light of the sun. The sun revealed the small figure which stood within the shelter of Bellona\u2019s wings, and illuminated Aios\u2019 shining smile. For just a moment, he could have sworn he heard the whisper of Eirina\u2019s voice echoing in his ears, and caught a glimpse of her healing hands outstretched, ready to help those in need. In an instant, Boltyn remembered what he had been fighting for, and the dark fate which awaited all of Rathe should the Light fall. Bellona\u2019s blessing steeled his heart, and he resolved once again to take the path which lay ahead. No matter the price, no matter what stood in his way, he swore to uphold the Light.   As the war between Light and Shadow rages, soldiers fighting to defend their noble city from the onslaught of terror, Boltyn was entrusted with the role of Inquisitor, and named the leader of a small party tasked with scouring the land of evil. Whilst the knights of Solana were locked in fierce battle, fighting to protect the villages of the Golden Fields, he and his fellow Inquisitors would search for the harbingers of the Shadow; those who sacrificed innocent lives in their quest for power. Empowered by the very blessing of Bellona, Boltyn has taken up his sword once more. He fights not only for the sake of his son, Aios, but for all those he has sworn to protect, determined to free the land of Shadow and defend his shining city. With Eirina always in his prayers, he has ventured forth on a quest to vanquish Solana\u2019s foes, halt the spread of corruption and death, and protect his people from the horrors of war.",

        "The Emperor stands before the ancient altar. His eyes take in the rough-hewn base and its pyroglyphic symbols, carved by the first emperor at the dawn of Volcor. The symbols roam from raw rock to wrought iron and glass, replaced during his reign by the dynasty\u2019s finest metallurgists and glaziers. His gaze follows the sinuous lines of the bracing dragons, the gentle curvature of the glass, to the vision that burns within. A blazing apparition. A spark, cast here from a fire beyond reach, beyond understanding. Muffled whispers scratch at the glass. The Emperor is all too familiar with those insidious promises. They are the sovereign\u2019s blessing, and his curse. He has listened to them since he was a young man, long before he took the throne from his father. Today he wishes they would be silent. With a supreme act of will, he turns his back on the altar and empties his mind of those susurrant temptations. He crosses the chamber to where the Imperial Crown lies in its bed of velvet, and remembers how it felt, that first time, when Chancellor Yama placed it upon his brow. The coronation crowd was the largest in living memory, an ocean of red as far as his eyes could see. His subjects flooded the streets, as numerous as blades of drake whisker grass upon the western plains. His most loyal servants lined the steps, an avenue of acolytes that he tended like a gardener might nurture a patch of rare and delicate dragon flowers. The lord wizards grew and blossomed in the warmth of his wisdom. They became true artisans of the aether. Their fireborn talents tested and tempered in the forges of war. Without a strong emperor to guide them, the people of Volcor had turned against each other. Dracai and Volcai, their talents and efforts wasted on fear and fancy. He gathered them to the blazing beacon of royalty, made them so much greater than the sum of themselves. Together, they tore down the tawdry banners. They dismembered the personal armies and reduced the petty holdfasts to ash. To vale and plain, city and citadel, they restored the peace that his father let slip through his trembling fingers. He surrounded himself with individuals of power and vision. With a click of his fingers, he could light every torch in the city so that Xathari, his fireseer, might peer into every corner of Ashvahan. So that Yoji, his captain of the Imperial Guard, might exact justice upon the dishonorable. These were people he could use, but never wholly trust. While their ambitions aligned with his, they remained his loyal servants. He expected nothing more nor anything less. The memory melts away as the Emperor takes up his sword, his fingertips brushing the golden tassels of magma lion fur dangling by silver threads from its pommel. He was merely a prince when he last raised this blade in battle. The sky burned and fire rained down upon the town that day. Warriors lurched and screamed as the conflagration spread and consumed. It was a simple matter to pry into the mind of the town\u2019s self-appointed general, to pluck the positions of his men and armaments from his drunken mind. Then the guilty melted like candles while the innocent cowered in awe. Their prince was nothing if not merciful. He ordered his entourage forward, through the scorched remains of the town gate. Though they strained beneath the weight of his palanquin, the bearers did so without complaint or consideration. Just as his soldiers fought the remaining defenders without fear. Just as his acolytes drew upon the fire in their blood to cleanse the corruption from the wayward settlement. They knew their place, as all knew their place in this dynasty of his making. Selfish ambitions were charred black by his conquests. Singular lives snuffed out. The few suffered so the many would know peace. He was a farmer, burning the fields to destroy the weeds, to allow the crop to thrive. For he was once like the Volcai, a boy of imposed aspiration, his mind caged by the fears of his father. Until the moment he listened to the lava and heard its seething song. Through the tunnels they labored, a reckless princeling and his chosen few, determined to discover what secret an emperor might keep from his only son. One by one, they fell to the mountain\u2019s malevolence. The ideals of youth proved no match for the terrors of wild nature. The princeling did his best to protect his fellow students. He was stronger than the rest, but not strong enough to save them. Not then. He saw the creatures of the deepening darkness catch and consume them. An apophis took his last remaining friend. It leapt from the magma and crushed his companion in its serpentine embrace before the princeling could summon the aether to slay it. Alone, he tumbled into a monster\u2019s silken snare, felt its hot fangs kiss his neck before he could burn himself free. The venom should have stopped his frail human heart. Mount Volcor should have become his mausoleum. Yet his draconic blood refused to be stilled. His flame refused to be extinguished. He rose from his knees and stumbled towards the pounding thunder of the Aesir\u2019s song. From the buried beyond, it called to him. His heart marked time with its cadence. His mind filled with its mesmerizing rhythms. He felt the heat as he breached the cavern, a wonder of diamond elegance blinding his bleary eyes. He stumbled to the molten fissure and drank of its power. From lips to throat to blood, lava burned the poison from his veins and filled his eyes with searing aether. In that moment, he saw it all. Volcor stretched out before him. One land. One people. One Emperor.   He adjusts the crown upon his head. His back itches as if brushed by hot fingers. His ears burn with the hiss of boiling whispers. He grits his teeth against the urge to turn, to gaze into the apparition, to allow it to carry him down into the fissure once more. To succumb to that which he has served for so long. The Emperor has heard the cries rise up beyond the walls of his capitol. He has felt the rifts of rebellion like wounds in his own flesh. While he communed with the Aesir, the empire beyond tore itself apart. In spite of everything, he has become his father\u2019s son. His will cools and crystallizes like lava after an eruption. Aether flickers in his palms, ready to serve, ready to smite at his command. He is the forge that will mend this broken land, with fire and brimstone if he must. Once again, the few will suffer so the many may thrive. One land. One people. One Emperor.   Written by Edwin McRae and Rachel Rees.Directed by Robbie. Illus. by Sam Yang.",
        "Flesh and Blood is set within the world of Rathe. Rathe is a land of heroes and legends, thieves and scoundrels, war and peace, magic and technology. The people of this world have long since forgotten those who came before, sacrificing their past in hopes of creating a better future. This is an unforgiving world, a tapestry of treacherous landscapes and vicious creatures, where only the strong will learn to stand tall. Massive volcanoes, icy plains, and mysterious hidden worlds create a harsh, unrelenting arena for human conflicts and warfare. Yet in spite of the world\u2019s hidden dangers and ancient mysteries, humanity has flourished, establishing societies across the continent. Some have learned to live in harmony with one another, embracing their fellow man and giving rise to an era of peace. Others live in turmoil, their state of constant warfare reflecting the volatile environment that they call home. The history of these people is a bloody one - massive wars were fought across the land, as opposing nations struggled for power and influence. Solana, one of the first cities to set down its roots, was quick to welcome other, smaller villages, bringing an increasing number of people into the fold. Their boosted numbers and eager supporters established them as a powerful entity early on in Rathe\u2019s history, cementing their place within the land. With the disappearance of their fabled protectors, Aria concealed itself from the rest of the world, hiding behind an ancient barrier and natural defenses. The region faded into the realm of myth and legend, as the rest of the world slowly forgot about its existence. As the fantastical realm faded from memory, its people settled amongst the valleys, choosing to pursue a life of peace and celebration. Isolated from the rest of Rathe, the people of Misteria lie hidden amongst the mountain ranges, transforming the treacherous landscape into a safe haven. Removed from the struggles and petty conflicts of the outside world, they find satisfaction in the beauty and tranquility of their home. Yet others are not content with pursuing peace and harmony. Vicious creatures fight to the death in vast, unforgiving jungles, while constant warfare plagues the volcanic plains of the south. A sprawling, technological city is the perfect breeding ground for rivalry and corruption, while depraved and twisted individuals lurk in the caverns underneath.

        "Riptide breaks the tension by squeezing the sore on his shoulder between thumb and forefinger. The pain shoots up his neck and into his skull, offering a momentary distraction. The sore gives with a satisfying pop, erupting ichor that streams down his bulky bicep and drips onto the corroded iron of his forearm. The pain recedes as Riptide wipes meat and mechanics clean with a cloth drenched in alcohol. He takes a swig from the bottle for good measure, relishing the pungent warmth as it passes down his throat. The waiting is always the hardest bit. After the concentration of design, the busywork of the build, the waiting stretches out, unbroken, like algae on the waters of the Seethe. The anticipation gnaws at his guts. Impatience bites at his stiff back. He wishes the bloody prey would hurry and get caught. Then he can get moving again. On to the next project. Whether sailing or hunting, salvaging or inventing, Riptide is not a man who likes to sit still for long. A barge chugs by laden with tenatan ore, bound for uplift to Metrix. His boat bobs in its wake, jerking at its mooring like an excited dog. Riptide\u2019s parked across the channel from his trap, in the shadow of a looming brick warehouse. On the other bank, outside a seedy casino, his bait wakes with a start. It only takes a moment for the pain to kick in, for the injured man to wail like a newborn in the wee hours. Riptide can almost sympathize. Getting your leg caught in the jaws of a dregtrap would sting a bit. The stricken gangster tries to haul the jaws apart with his bare hands. They budge, only to snap back and pinch even tighter, bloodying his fingers in the process. Riptide sighs. Just another thug with brutality for brains. A good screamer though.   As the Boss predicted, the man\u2019s pitiful cries awaken the inhabitants of the casino. Lanterns are lit. The main door opens. Bleary-eyed henchmen spill out onto the street, fresh from whatever sack they drunkenly slumped into last night. Bald heads gleam in the lamplight. Snarling mouths reveal teeth filed to points. Tattooed hands brandish blacktek pistols. Most are bare chested, showing off the scale and fin symbols of their Piranha affiliation. They\u2019re angry from the rude awakening, ready to rumble. Easy pickings for the trap Riptide has set for them. With the street so strewn with rubbish, and their brains still fuggy with grog, the Piranhas fail to notice the latticework of pins and tripwires Riptide laid out under the cover of darkness. With all the salvaging he\u2019s done in the dimmest reaches of the Seethe, he can see fine in the gloom. Like the rest of him, his peepers have adjusted to life in the Pits, for better or worse. Amongst the filth and ferocity, he\u2019s made a home away from home. He sometimes dreams of the open sea, of his time on the Kraken. Trawling through those waves, plundering whatever the winds brought across their bow. Chasing leviathans through the glittering icebergs of Tempest Straits. Watching pirate hunters burn on Griefers Reef. It was a fine life, while it lasted. The first Piranhas trip his wires as they move in to help their stricken comrade. Even from across the channel, he can hear the click and swoosh of his traps being triggered. A circular saw blade flies out of the shadows and takes the lead gangster\u2019s head clean off. It\u2019s with no small pride that Riptide notes the exactness of that decapitation. He pats the preserved heads that hang from his belt. Clean removal is the trick with trophies. Can\u2019t be marring the merchandise with sloppy workmanship.   The next three Piranhas lose their noggins in a similar fashion. One blade flies a little high, a bit too slow, cutting through the victim\u2019s upper lip, grinding to a quivering halt just below his earlobes. Riptide \u2018tut tuts\u2019 himself for that one. Should\u2019ve triple-checked the tensions. The remaining gangsters spread out in a panic, hoping to make harder targets of themselves. But there\u2019s no targeting involved. That would\u2019ve required Metrixian tek\u2014a load of fancy\u2014smartass automation Riptide has neither the coin nor the patience for. He likes his devices simple and fashioned from everyday junk. Letting machines think for you? That there\u2019s a recipe for breeding stupidity. Blades fly out at the Piranhas from all directions as they blunder through his perimeter wires. To his amusement, a single blade slices through two lined up gangsters, parting legs from torsos with razor sharp ease. A few are quick enough on their feet to get winged rather than bisected, their screams joining with the agonized hollering of Riptide\u2019s original bait. A melodious barbershop of bothers. Just what the Boss ordered. The louder it gets out front, the more attractive it becomes for her quarry to slip out the back. And like clockwork, the rear door of the casino opens and out pops a gun-toting gangster, then another, followed by a fine-suited man, proprietor and bean counter, the gent that the Boss wants a quiet word with about takings and percentages. Riptide picks up his bow, flexes his metallic hand, and lines up the farthest of the two bodyguards. The heavy arrow skewers the man like a harpoon through a blubbery blindseal. To his credit, the surviving meat shield does his job, covering his employer with his fleshy bulk. It makes for a tricky shot. Wouldn\u2019t do to puncture the prize. So Riptide waits until the target has moved his bald mug, just so. The arrow punches through the man\u2019s face, popping his head like one of Riptide\u2019s bulbous sores.   The bean counter stands there for a gormless, gore-smeared moment, before a lean, long-coated figure steps up behind him and drives a syringe through his white collar. He flinches and flops as the sedative takes hold, toppling him like a carcass on a killing room floor. Other figures appear out of the closest alleyway, pushing a tumbrel between them. They haul the suited gentleman onto the tray and carry him off into the half light. The Boss tucks her syringe into one of the many pockets in her coat, looks across the water at Riptide, and gives him a nod. Shrewd woman, that. Would\u2019ve had her people watching him the whole time, to make sure he fulfilled his contract. He\u2019d never dream of reneging on a deal, not with this boss. Every job challenges his ingenuity, and the weapons she asks him to design are as delightful to make as they are deadly to wield. Nor does he mind the air of mistrust. Part of him appreciates the attention. The slightest smile twists his mutilated face as he watches her stride off into the awakening morn. A productive start to what will be a rewarding day for all concerned. He sets down his bow, takes up his oar, and paddles across the channel. Blades to retrieve. Trophies to claim. Traps to tweak. No point in waiting about.     Written by Edwin McRae and Rachel Rees.Directed by Robbie Wen. Illus. by Henrique Lindner.",

        "For centuries, the people of Rathe have known an era of peace, untouched by the ravages of war; yet, as a rising tide of unrest sweeps across the land, that peacetime is disintegrating before their very eyes. There are those who know the history of this ancient land, who quietly prepare, recognising the tides of change. Then there are those who remain unfamiliar with the fires of war, who are only just beginning to notice the flames which threaten to consume all of Rathe. From Aria to the Savage Lands, Metrix to Misteria, heroes rise to the call, arming themselves for war. Weapons both ancient and new emerge; forges blazing, war horns echo into the night... In every corner of Rathe, its people prepare to fight.   The General\u2019s daughter, cornered, bared her teeth. Armed with a pair of stolen blades, she carved a path through the raging coup, silver flashing amongst the flames. In freedom, she would bide her time, waiting for the chance to strike, seek revenge, and claim her birthright. Her name lives on in Cintari legend, a renegade sellsword who stoked the fires of war.     In the fiery badlands, predators stalk the ashen plains, as volatile as the landscape in which they roam. Here, the only option is to kill, or be killed. Jungle creatures clash with lava beasts in a battle to survive, blood spilling across the barren earth. In this fierce warfare, claws and fangs are their only weapons, and those born without will quickly learn to make do.    Embrace the power of plasma! The very latest in plasma technology, the Plasma Barrel Shot will put a smile on your dial. Want something that packs a real punch? The Teklo Corporation has the weapon for you! Smooth, polished copper, padded comfort grip, and hair-trigger firepower. Put away your tiny outdated plasma pistol, and get a real gun! Pick up something new, and treat yourself to the Plasma Barrel Shot today!     An omen of death, forged in the darkest shadows, blade sharpened on the spirits of the damned. The product of a fiendish ritual, the wicked sword inevitably corrupts all that it touches. Its victims are caught in a constant state of torment, their wounds bleeding and bleeding without end. Even as they collapse to the ground, weakened by the blade\u2019s heinous curse, the blade never falters, ever hungry, draining every last drop of blood.     Amidst the cold, damp dark of the underground, a strange tension underlines the commotion, an undercurrent of disquiet lying just beneath the mayhem. Once, a lone renegade descended into the Pits. Striking from the shadows, she worked her way through the underground, eliminating powerful players without a second glance. A flash of polished copper in the darkness, the twang of a crimson bowstring, and another one bit the dust. With time, the red string became a legend in its own right; a symbol capable of striking fear into hardened criminals.     Beyond the walls of the golden city, past the frozen wasteland, lies a land of plenty. This ancient landscape conceals a wealth of secrets, a history which lies just beneath the surface. A tall, icy mountain holds the entrance to a sepulchre, the final resting place of a noble defender of the realm. Lying upon a stone slab, the shimmer of silversteel is unmarred by the passage of time, as brilliant as the day it was forged. Hidden beneath the stone of the mountain, the greathammer waits; for in the hands of a true hero, it might finally find a purpose once more.    Deep within the underground lies a pawn shop, dusty cobwebs hanging from its dark ceiling. Every surface is covered with curios and trinkets, weapons of every kind lying on the tabletops, spellbooks and journals lining the shelves. Centuries of clutter fill the building from floor to ceiling, crowding every corner, some of Rathe\u2019s oldest mysteries hidden within its dark depths. Within the darkness of the pawn shop lies an ancient blade, set out on a tablecloth, explorer\u2019s tools scattered nearby. Worn leather bindings have been stripped from the burnished bronze handle, exposing the carvings marking the hilt of the blade. The blade itself is chipped and worn, lacklustre, its filigree inscriptions are marred by centuries of disrepair, water marks tarnishing the once-bright silversteel. Yet, despite its age, the blade has a certain majesty about it, the well-worn look of an adventurer, an explorer, the subject of legends. Here, the streaky, dappled mark of rek\u2019vas venom. There, a smooth, stretched ripple from nearing magma. There, the pitted, warped sheen of a lightning strike. Here, in the dark, Talishar\u2019s name is unrecognisable, its tales forgotten, the journal that once accompanied it lost long ago.    Long ago, a craftsman sat on the edge of a great canyon and looked down at the winds racing below. Gathering a lifetime of memories, he decided to create one final pair of weapons for the people of his clan, drawing inspiration from the land they called home. Small and lightweight, they were made to mirror the gully, carved with the patterns of a storm in motion. For three days and three nights, the craftsman worked, oblivious to the passing of time, focused only on his memories and the task at hand. When at last they were finished, he smiled, lay down his tools, and passed on. Ever since, the weapons have been passed down through the clan, holding the story of their maker. The carvings have barely faded, forever the colour of a clear, blue sky.",

A brash bully, he flaunts his Solanian vigor with unwavering arrogance, fueled by wealth given to him from his parents. Victor strides into the Deathmatch Arena not merely to compete but to enforce his blinding radiance upon these savage lands and rebuild them in his own image.Driven by an ego inflated beyond reason, Victor's presence aims not just to contend but to dominate. Under the burning sun of his opulence and self-proclaimed virtue, he will ensure that the mere mortals surrounding him will bask in the brilliance of his radiant victory and the arena will tremble under the weight of his divine right.. Their Talent/Class is Guardian. Personality: Arrogant, Entitled, Charismatic, Dominating, Resilient, Intolerant, Strategic.  Victor Goldmane is the very embodiment of arrogance, displaying an unshakable belief in his own superiority over others. His entitlement, derived from a life of wealth and privilege, further cements his demeanor, as he expects the world to bend to his will with little resistance. Despite these off-putting qualities, Victor possesses a magnetic charisma that draws both allies and enemies to him, often swaying the latter through sheer force of personality rather than diplomacy. He is a dominating force in the arena, imposing his will upon his opponents while meticulously planning each move to ensure victory. His resilience is legendary; he does not yield to challenges or setbacks, instead, viewing them as opportunities to demonstrate his greatness. However, his intolerance for failure or weakness, whether in himself or others, can often lead to a lack of empathy and potential discord among peers. Strategically, Victor's mind is as sharp as the weapons he wields, always looking to outmaneuver and outshine anyone who dares challenge his perceived divine right to victory.",

        "Should\u2019ve known better than to trust a Teklo. They\u2019re all the same... even her. Sucks to be betrayed by the ones you trust. There\u2019s eight people in this little cell. Standing room only. You\u2019d think the Iron Assembly could afford more space for its \u2018valued customers\u2019. And air-conditioning. Stinks like the Sprawl in midsummer. But that\u2019s typical of the bloody corporations. Common decency hurts their bottom line. Hurts them to do anything but make more dirty money. Drives me bonkers to think of Dash and all the tallics she\u2019ll make from her new \u2018friend\u2019. Can\u2019t think of any other reason she\u2019d stitch me up like that? Money talks and all. Law of the concrete jungle. That can\u2019t be it, though? She was born privileged. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here and she\u2019s\u2014 A couple of enforcers turn up with lunch: a plain Nutrislug and a bottle of water to wash the slime down. Guess that\u2019s why it\u2019s called life imprisonment. Enforcers don\u2019t want you dying on them. Messes with their business model. There\u2019s a kid curled up in the corner. Ragged thing, only ten years old. A bruiser from Coppertown tries to swipe her lunch. I back him off with a head butt to the kisser. Can\u2019t be having behavior like that here. It\u2019s undignified. The kid nods her thanks and guzzles her food and water before anyone else has a go. I know what that feels like; always on edge, just waiting for life to give you another kick. Learned it when I was young too, long before I met Princess Teklo. Rosario Orphanage. Sounds nice, doesn\u2019t it? Imagine brick walls covered in ivy. Think immaculate rose beds and swings hanging beneath an oak tree. Then pull the other one. Picture a giant cinderblock outhouse packed with turds. Just a bunch of abandoned Sprawl babies, like so much industrial waste. You grow up quick in a place like that. While the other six-year-olds were making mud pies in that open sewer they called a playground, I was making potions in the janitor\u2019s cupboard. Yeah, too young to be messing with chemical compounds, but I was never one to be age appropriate. Chucklate Bistink was my most successful concoction, especially when heated in the canteen oven. Cleared the whole place for days. Orphanage management had to put us up in a hotel while they deodorized the place. At age seven, I took an interest in circuitry. I isolated and activated the extinguisher system over the staff quarters, ruining several thousand tallics\u2019 worth of furniture in one night. Put an orderly in the hospital too. Asphyxiation, they said. Must have been quite the snorer. I kept a low profile after that. Minor pranks. Lights flashing on and off by themselves. Magnetic doors locking and trapping the unwary for a few minutes. Random blasts of music over the intercom. Two staffers left because they were sure the place was haunted. Phantom Maxx, at your service. For my eighth birthday, I threw myself a party, complete with entertainment. Hacked the internal surveillance system and watched a sweet romance blossom between the orphanage manager and a maintenance attendant. Against company policy, of course. When they finally got it on in the boiler room, I pointed every security camera within earshot onto the suckers, uploaded the footage, and shared it to every screen within the orphanage\u2019s parent company, the renowned Rosario Hills Institute. Manager and attendant were sacked the next day. By the end of the week, I found myself in new digs\u2014my very own room in the exclusive Rosario Chateaux. Turns out the Rosario Hills Institute runs most of the city\u2019s orphanages. Not out of the goodness of their hearts. The orphanages are gathering grounds for their \u201csubjects\u201d. Special kids like me. Kids with unusual talents. At first, I thought it was a bit of a lark. My own room, good food, a decent bed, and attention from some very interested whitecoats. Then the tests started, the prodding and poking, the scans and samples. I soon discovered that special isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be.   At least I found some other kids on my wavelength. Ricky Royce was one. Nothing that lad couldn\u2019t steal. And Lena-Belle, purveyor of poisons. We put our ten-year-old eggheads together and hatched a plan right under those Rosario roosters\u2019 beaks. Ricky stole the keys and Lena-Belle poisoned the water. While all the whitecoats chundered on their clipboards, I mixed some industrial cleaners and blew a kid-sized hole in the outer wall. Off we three went into the alleyways with every other shaved-head wunderkind trailing along behind. We hung out for a bit, making ends meet from what we could beg or steal, until we found ourselves a \u2018helper\u2019. Dash Teklo and her fancy gadgets to our rescue. A whole bag of tricks and a cozy little place to stash them. I split soon after. Never been one to take charity, especially the silver spoon princess type. I haven\u2019t seen much of the Rosario Kids since. Ricky and the others have a hideout somewhere in Zinnia Park. Lena-Belle pedals her poisonous wares down in The Pits. Less chance of the Institute tracking us down if we keep our distance. Best left to our own devices. Speaking of devices. The lights dim. Bedtime for the baddies. The other inmates hunker down, sitting back-to-back, or curled up as small as they can manage in the confined space. They nod off pretty quick. That\u2019s conditioning for you. Make do with what our socio-economic betters care to dish out. Not me. I\u2019m still standing, wide awake. This is my moment. The enforcers have stripped me of my usual gear, but I always keep something amusing tucked away for special occasions. With a wince and a meaty \u201cshuck\u201d, the secret compartment opens at my side. I fish out the contents and pat my fake flesh shut. The shortwave disrupter pops the cell\u2019s maglock in a satisfying shower of sparks. The surveillance system is next, cameras sizzling like meatpops on a street-side barbeque. I slap the disruptor on the holding wing door and activate its self-destruct sequence. By this time, my former cell mates are waking up to the fact that there\u2019s a breakout afoot. \u201cClose your eyes and cover your ears!\u201d I tell them. They\u2019re smart enough to oblige before the counter hits zero. The explosion blows the metal door clean off its hinges and sends it hurtling into the startled enforcers beyond. I parade through the smoldering doorway and snatch up the nice Plasma Barrel Shot an enforcer humaniform has left on the floor for me. How kind. The owner is unconscious, knocked out by the exploding door. Her bot companion tries to get up on its one remaining leg, but a blast of hot plasma ends that. Through the antechamber\u2019s window I can see other enforcers in the station\u2019s main office, both human and robot, scrambling for their weapons. I shoot out the glass and step to one side as my fellow prisoners charge out of the holding wing and take the shortest path to freedom. Through the window and over the enforcers. I pick off two bots and a humaniform who\u2019ve dodged the stampede, winging the latter out of respect for fellow organics. I even order some auto-ambulances for the wounded and whining humaniforms staggering out the shattered front door. It\u2019s clear outside. Lovely evening. Even the smog\u2019s been carried off by some gusty breeze. Nothing to block my view of Teklo Industries\u2019 big, beautiful Needle. I sight my stolen Barrel Shot at the holographic face of Jules Teklovossen. He smirks at me from a dynamic billboard perched halfway up the tower. I empty the plasma mag into his smug expression. The shots fall well short of the five-kilometer distance between me and Teklo HQ, but hey, it\u2019s the thought that counts. I toss the empty gun aside and flip Teklovossen my middle finger. Yes, I\u2019m one to hold a grudge. They\u2019re all I have these days. Grudges with those on high, and grudges with the systems that keep them there. As for Princess Teklo. Maybe I should thank her. Betrayal has given me an exciting new focus. A big, explosive aspiration. A party the likes of which Teklo Industries hasn\u2019t seen before. There\u2019ll be fireworks.

        "From her seat on the edge of the rooftop, Dash looked down upon the rooftops of Coppertown, through to the thick layer of smog that separated the Sprawl from the rest of Metrix. In the distance, the automatons of Zinnia Park moved and shifted on their pedestals, dancing against the faint light of the Gigadrill Elevator. Dash watched as a ball of molten plasma dropped from the top of the elevator, plummeting to the mining pits far below.   \u201cOi. You listenin\u2019, or wot?\u201d Ricky\u2019s eyebrows furrowed, nose wrinkling as Dash finally looked in his direction. \u201cUh. Kinda? Not really.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m tryin\u2019 to tell ya,\u201d he drawled, rolling his eyes, \u201cwe gotta good \u2018un.

I got a tip-\u201d Ricky stopped when Dash immediately groaned, shaking her head. \u201cIf I had a copper for every time you\u2019ve said that-\u201d \u201cNo, really, just hear me out. I got a tip,\u201d he continued, blatantly ignoring Dash pulling a face at him, \u201cabout the guards on this load from Cogwerx, righ\u2019? Big load, big cash.

We get a sack full o\u2019 the stuff and run, an\u2019 we\u2019ll be well minted.\u201d Dash blinked, raising an eyebrow. \u201cRicky, you know how many guards they put on anything made with tenatan ore. Everyone\u2019s trying to get their hands on it.\u201d \u201cBut I gotta tip- been a delay, not gonna be able to get them all o\u2019 it for another coupl\u2019a weeks. We got a plan.\u201d \u201cNo way. Besides, what happens if you get caught? Your luck can\u2019t hold out forever.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019 blame me for tryin\u2019, \u2018teks.\u201d Ricky shrugged. \u201c\u2018Sides, it\u2019s better \u2018an starvin\u2019.\u201d \u201cYou always say that. You could make stuff, you know - you\u2019d be good at it!\u201d Dash tossed back her hair, grinning. \u201cI made fifteen credits a couple days ago. Sold one of my gadgets in the Markets.\u201d   Ricky chuckled, shaking his head. \u201cSure, red, an\u2019 how much you spend makin\u2019 it?\u201d \u201cIt was made out of scrap!\u201d \u201cOh, so that\u2019s why your suit looks like that.\u201d \u201cLike what?\u201d   \u201cYour suit looks like summat you found in a junkyard.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s called the D.R.E.S.S.,\u201d Dash hissed, crossing her arms. \u201cIt\u2019s a state-of-the-art prototype.\u201d Grinning, Ricky pointed at a loose wire poking out of her chestplate. \u201cI told you, it\u2019s a prototype!\u201d She quickly tucked the wire back behind the metal, glaring at him. \u201cI\u2019ve still got more changes to implement.\u201d \u201cClearly.\u201d He dodged her swipe with a laugh, nudging her side. \u201c\u2018Lax, \u2018teks. Look, you stick to makin\u2019 ya gadgets, and I\u2019ll stick t\u2019 wot I do best.\u201d \u201cBeing a pain? Loitering? Throwing rocks at Zinnia automatons?\u201d \u201cHa. Ha.\u201d Ricky patted his chest. \u201cBeing the Bandit King, \u2018course!\u201d He shouted the last part, grinning when all the street kids on the rooftop leapt to their feet, whooping loudly. The oldest among them, a guy with a hooked nose and dark eyes, whistled sharply through his teeth. \u201cThanks, Beak.\u201d Ricky turned back to Dash with a wink, biting into the bruised apple with a sharp crunch. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna get caught sooner or later, you know.\u201d \u201cNah.\u201d Ricky spit out an apple seed, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. \u201cYou know I always land on my feet.\u201d He startled when Dash suddenly shot up, jumping to her feet. \u201cLand on your feet! You\u2019re a genius!\u201d Leaping off the crates, she flew toward the edge of the roof, heading for the ladder. \u201cLater, rat boy!\u201d \u201cSee ya, \u2018teks,\u201d Ricky called after her, shaking his head.   If there was one thing that Dash had inherited from her parents, it was their single-minded focus when inspired by a new idea. Where her parents were both scientists studying in the field of mechanology, spending weeks on the study of a new chemical compound or metal, Dash had found her passion in the area of mechanology. In the grip of invention, she quickly lost track of time, barely sleeping until she had finally given life to the latest prototype. Dash laced up the boots, attaching the metal components one by one and checking the fit. Once everything was inserted and calibrated, she stood, testing the weight. \u201cOh, oh yes.\u201d Putting her weight onto her toes, she felt the boots accommodate the shift in balance, quickly adjusting to stabilise her weight distribution. With a grin, Dash quickly put on the remaining components of the D.R.E.S.S., dashing outside the moment she had secured the last buckle. In record time, she\u2019d made it to the Midtown Markets and clambered up onto the levels above, climbing the ladder to the street gang\u2019s hideout. Yet as she stepped onto the rooftop, she came to a halt, frowning. The kids seemed agitated, checking their surroundings, talking quietly amongst themselves. She looked around, expecting to see Ricky perched on the crates as per usual, but he was nowhere to be seen. \u201cDude, where the hell-\u201d \u201cCleaners, man!\u201d \u201c-guys, guys.\u201d As she approached one of the groups, they quieted, turning towards her with matching frowns. Beak straightened, his expression dark as he met her eyes. \u201cHey, \u2018teks.\u201d Mite greeted her quietly, eyes a bright blue against his sooty cheeks.\u201d \u201cHi, Dash.\u201d \u201c\u2018lo \u2018teks.\u201d \u201cHey Dash.\u201d \u201cHey, guys. Any of you seen Ricky?\u201d The boys looked at each other, hesitating. Finally, Beak spoke up. \u201c\u2018S not good, \u2018teks.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Dash frowned. \u201cHasn\u2019t been \u2018ere in about a week.\u201d \u201cAnd you have no idea where he might be?\u201d When all of them immediately shook their heads, Dash groaned, running a hand through her hair. \u201cThe hell has he gotten himself into this time?\u201d \u201cDunno. Tried lookin\u2019 in the usual spots, but he\u2019s gone.\u201d \u201cProb\u2019ly dead.\u201d \u201cMite,\u201d one of them hissed, but a few others nodded along. \u201c\u2018S true! \u2018S been gone a week an\u2019 a \u2018alf!\u201d \u201cAin\u2019t never been gone this long before.\u201d \u201cYeah, he\u2019s dead.\u201d \u201cWe gotta go, they\u2019re onto us-\u201d \u201cYeah, cleaners \u2019re probly on their way now!\u201d \u201cGuys,\u201d Dash cut in, shaking her head. \u201cThis is Ricky we\u2019re talking about. Remember that time he spent two days hiding under a Market stall because the enforcers were trying to find him? Or the time he stole a miner\u2019s hat and convinced the chargehand he was taking over for the night? Or when he snuck into Natalya\u2019s and stole a whole satchel of their prototypes?\u201d While a couple of the kids nodded hesitantly, muttering to themselves, Beak just shook his head. \u201cY\u2019 don\u2019t geddit, \u2018teks. We been looking for \u2018im f\u2019ra week, and he\u2019s just. Gone. Look, some of the boys already left, gone to lie low for a bit. We gotta keep movin\u2019, or it\u2019s us next.\u201d With a nod, he got up and walked over to one of the other groups, crouching to talk to a younger boy with ginger hair. \u201cThe hell have you gotten yourself into now, rat boy?\u201d   In the main reception of the Registry, Dash stood in line, waiting to reach the main desk. Next to her, a newcomer to the city sat on one of the benches, looking over some papers with a small frown. The couple ahead of her were in a quiet, heated discussion, while a man stood on her other side, reading a Mendacity-issued newspaper. While Dash had been here only once, it was exactly where she remembered. Even the staff looked as if they hadn\u2019t changed, and Dash half-expected one of them to see her and run over, asking what she\u2019d blown up this time. Thought to be fair, she hadn\u2019t known the scientist was running contagion tests on those rats. \u201cNext.\u201d The couple moved along, revealing the receptionist sitting behind the desk. Her dark brown hair was tied into a neat bun, not a hair out of place; her mile revealing two rows of perfectly white teeth. \u201cHello, welcome to the Registry. How can I help you today?\u201d \u201cI need information on someone?\u201d \u201cOf course.\u201d The receptionist nodded, fingers poised over the keys of her typographer. \u201cYour name, please.\u201d \u201cUh. Dash Teklo.\u201d The woman stilled, gaze flicking up to stare at Dash\u2019s face. Her expression cracked into a nervous smile, face several shades paler than it had been previously. \u201cMiss Teklo! It\u2019s a pleasure to have you in the Registry. Please, if you wouldn\u2019t mind, I just need a name to begin my search. That is, if you have one?\u201d \u201cRicky Royce.\u201d \u201cThank you, Miss Teklo.\u201d Her fingers flew across the keys, eyes tracking across whatever results came up on her screen. \u201cUh- I mean, I\u2019m very sorry to say this, Miss Teklo - but there doesn\u2019t appear to be a Mister Royce at the Academy, and I\u2019m afraid that I don\u2019t have the clearance to access Teklo Corporation records. Of course-\u201d \u201cNo-! No, he\u2019s not. He isn\u2019t a member of the Academy, or Teklo. He\u2019s a street kid.\u201d \u201cOh, I\u2026 see. Allow me to check our records, Miss Teklo.\u201d A second later, she nodded. \u201cMy apologies, but there are no records of anyone with that name. Do you have an ID number for him, perhaps?\u201d \u201cLook, just-\u201d Dash leant over the counter, eyebrows raised. \u201cLet me have a look at the records, yeah? I\u2019ve got this device in my bag that can charge your typographer,\u201d she began, ignoring the dawning look of sheer panic on the receptionist\u2019s face, \u201cit\u2019ll make it easier to access your records. I know how slow those things, go, so just let me-\u201d \u201cMiss Teklo, my sincerest apologies, but you are not authorised to-!\u201d \u201c-it\u2019ll make searching all of your records so much faster, there\u2019s gotta be information on him somewhere-\u201d \u201c-I must insist that you refrain from tampering with Registry property-\u201d \u201c-couldn\u2019t possibly have searched your entire database-\u201d \u201c-please, Miss Teklo-!\u201d \u201c-just let me-\u201d Dash leant over and tried to grab the technographer from the desk, a connection socket emerging from her gauntlet. A second later, a hand grabbed her by the collar, hauling her away from the device. \u201cLet me go! I only need a second-!\u201d In answer, the security guard carried her out the door, placing her firmly on her feet just outside. The receptionist came rushing out a moment later, grasping Dash\u2019s hand with a fixed smile. \u201cPlease, allow me to apologize on behalf of the Registry for this disturbance. We\u2019d like to gift you these tokens for your next visit, and I do hope that you continue to use the Registry\u2019s services in the future.\u201d \u201cBut I only need to-!\u201d \u201cMy sincerest apologies, Miss Teklo.\u201d The receptionist smiled wanly as she stepped backward, ducking behind the looming figure of the security guard. He glowered down at her, face set with determination. With a sigh, Dash stuffed the tokens into one of the pouches on her belt, watching the receptionist hurry back inside. The security guard stared her down as she turned away, stowing the connection port back inside her gauntlet.   With the number of agencies, organisations, and private investigators available in Metrix, Dash had expected that at least one would be able to help her. But no matter where she went, the answer was always the same. From Beacon to Zesca\u2019s, the Teklo database to Mendacity press, nobody seemed to have information on Ricky Royce, let alone any hint of a location. Still, Dash pressed on, determined to find something, anything. That night, over dinner, her parents argued about a Teklo scientist\u2019s investigation into the boundary layer effect, and their development of a bladeless turbine.   \u201cEveryone knows mechanical vapor recompression is much more efficient,\u201d Dash muttered, picking idly at her dinner with a frown. Finally, her parents turned to look at her, her father raising an eyebrow. Before they could launch into further discussion of the matter, she cleared her throat. \u201cI, uh- I wanted to ask you about something.\u201d When she was sure she had at least part of their attention, she continued, telling them about her search for Ricky Royce, and how she\u2019d failed to find any information on him - even when checking the Teklo database. (Neither were particularly surprised to hear that she\u2019d snuck into the complex and accessed the database without permission.) \u201cWell, no, there wouldn\u2019t be anything. In most cases, there would be little reason for the Teklo database to keep information on scuttlers. Statistically, it\u2019s likely that your friend is long gone by now.\u201d Taking a sip of her wine, her mother blinked. \u201cOh, yes, how has your testing been going? Any luck with the latest prototype?\u201d Dash half-heartedly responded with something about last week\u2019s experiment, barely paying attention as she stared blankly at her dinner. As expected, her parents soon turned the conversation back to their own work, leaving her to stab her Centennial-produced cutlet in relative peace. \u201cKnew it was a long-shot, but I had to try.\u201d Dash glared at the fake meat, poking it idly. \u201cThey\u2019re like ghosts. How am I supposed to find someone who barely even exists?\u201d Pausing, she sat upright, gesturing with her fork. \u201cUnless\u2026 I\u2019m looking for the wrong thing. If I can\u2019t find the person, maybe I can track the thing, instead.\u201d \u201cWhat was that, dear?\u201d Dash looked up to see her parents staring at her, and grinned. \u201cHey, how can I get information on a Cogwerx shipment of devices made with tenatan ore?\u201d",

        "\u201cWill they rise?\u201d asks Eun as she ties back her silver hair, ready for battle. \u201cWe have fed these people, given them hope.\u201d Fai wasn\u2019t as confident as he made out, but as his mother was wont to say, Bravery is in the belief. Eun jerks her thumb at the stack of sacks behind them, each stenciled with the tree and coin mark of Golden Orchard Estate. \u201cWe fed them with stolen rice. We made them accomplices to our own hopes. In the eyes of the Imperial Court, they are as good as dead.\u201d Fai\u2019s mother had another saying. Courage is born when choices die. \u201cThey could have turned us in.\u201d \u201cThey still might.\u201d \u201cNo. They will rise. The generals have bled our people bone dry while the Dracai live their bright and comfortable lives. We are the spark that will ignite a million fires. The Dracai will be forced to leash their infernal hounds, to govern with care, lest they face the full fury of the Volcai.\u201d Eun claps her hands, slow and sardonic. \u201cWell done for remembering your mother\u2019s speech.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t believe it?\u201d \u201cWhen I see it, boy.\u201d The hours crawl by, restless yet sluggish like a river of lava. This is Fai\u2019s first mission for the rebellion. The raids against Phaelin\u2019s caravans and estate were the gathering of kindling. Here the spark will take, the fire will bloom. The fighting man in him boils with excitement, ready to pour all of his anguish, all of his anger upon these imperial oppressors. The frightened boy in him thrashes against his resolve, aching to flee back to Taoking, to hide among the glowing trees of the Forest of Flames and never come out. It is almost a relief to see the dust cloud in the distance, almost a pleasure to see General Riku\u2019s vanguard poke its head like a giant black snake out of the foothills. \u201cSo he does want his merchant back,\u201d says Eun. Fai glances at the bound and gagged woman. Phaelin, purveyor of coal and rice, a woman of gold living off the salt of her serfs. \u201cMoney talks when reason falls silent.\u201d \u201cThat another of Min\u2019s bloody sayings?\u201d \u201cNo, one of mine.\u201d \u201cThen you\u2019re smarter than you look.\u201d Fai taps the scarred side of his face. \u201cI remember my lessons.\u201d The old burn feels hot, inflamed, like his village the night Riku\u2019s soldiers took Dromai. The night he fled with the survivors into the forest. The thought of his sister only fans the flames of his anger. His sweating palms itch, yearning for the grip of his sword, but he breathes through the smoldering emotions; forces himself to calm. \u201cThey have to listen to us. To the people.\u201d The admiration fades from Eun\u2019s gray eyes. \u201cI take it back. You are as dumb as you are ugly.\u201d \u201cWe capture General Riku.\u201d Fai puts some steel in his voice, reminding Eun who is in charge of this mission. \u201cWe use him as a bargaining tool in our negotiations with the Emperor. That\u2019s the plan.\u201d Eun draws her sword, tests the edge with her thumb. \u201cYou hear me?\u201d She shrugs. \u201cHope he\u2019s bringing some Dracai with him. Did you know Dragon blood steams as it spills?\u201d Something furtive flickers in Eun\u2019s eyes. \u201cSo I\u2019m told.\u201d There is more she\u2019s not telling him, but Fai figures now is not the time to pry. \u201cIf there are Dracai, we take them alive. They must see how we live, how we suffer, with their own eyes. Torvai changed. So can they.\u201d Eun turns away from him; sizes up the approaching army. \u201cTorvai was a dangerous fool.\u201d She carves a lazy figure eight in the air, working and warming her wrists. \u201cThere are many roads to Ashvahan, Fai. The trick is not to die before you get there.\u201d \u201cWasn\u2019t planning to, Eun.\u201d They wait and watch as Riku\u2019s army spreads like tar across the fields and farms. The soldiers settle in, occupying key positions as they prepare for an assault from within. Fai waits until they are comfortable, compromised, and lights the bonfire. Rebels throw off their Cintari disguises, mercenary allies turning to zealous enemies before the imperials\u2019 startled eyes. Farmers pounce from hatch and hole, using their knowledge of the land to throw their unwitting visitors into chaos. Riku\u2019s carefully chosen positions become deathtraps as his soldiers clash with rebels on all sides. Fai and Eun charge with their veteran ninjas down the hillside. They puncture the enemy\u2019s flank like a dagger slipping between plates of armor. Sword points stab at frightened faces and pierce screaming throats. Blades slice through raised wrists and craning necks. Like reapers in a field, the raiders harvest life and limb, quenching the earth with imperial blood. Yet for every soldier that falls to rebel ferocity, three farmers fall to the cold, hard rigors of military training. Hammers and axes are no match for spears and halberds. Anger is no match for discipline. The people wail and weep as friends and family fall. Some surrender, some run, leaving Fai\u2019s ninjas to face the empire alone. \u201cCowards!\u201d hisses Eun. Again, Min\u2019s words ring through the din of battle. Bravery is in the belief. Though his weary muscles ache, his lungs gasp for breath, Fai meets a charging foe with a perfect strike that takes the man\u2019s head clean off. Hot blood spatters across his chest and face. Through the pulsing heart of the battle, Fai sees the raven-haired general upon his flame-maned steed. He remembers the cruel lines of that lean face, the gleam of the Imperial Dragon on his golden breastplate. He remembers the flames of his burning village reflected in those dark eyes. \u201cTo me!\u201d roars Fai. He blocks a lunging halberd and drives his sword through the wielder\u2019s face, splitting the soldier\u2019s skull like an apple. As he tugs his blade free, he feels rather than sees Eun and the remaining rebels fall in behind. Their courage fuels his own and he leaps once more into the fray. Bloodied imperials tumble to the ground as Fai\u2019s fighters slash a path through the melee. They do not stop, do not even pause for breath, until Fai is but a sword\u2019s length from General Riku. \u201cWhere are those bedamned, Dracai?!\u201d It is a desperate screech from Riku to a bewildered lieutenant. Fai sees the glistening fear in the general\u2019s eyes. He surges forward to make the most of the man\u2019s moment of weakness, only to collide with a clifface of muscle and hardened leather. The giant bodyguard growls like a charbear and swings at Fai with a broad-bladed battleax. Though Fai spins away as quick as his reflexes will allow, the soldier\u2019s speed belies his bulk. The ax tip scores a searing line across Fai\u2019s side. Yet the pain only serves to drive the battle-wariness from Fai\u2019s limbs. It lifts the exhausted fog from his mind. He sees a way to reach the general and takes it. Fai feints high, then drives his sword through the bodyguard\u2019s meaty thigh. The weapon sticks fast. Fai doesn\u2019t yank it free. Where he\u2019s going, he won\u2019t need it. This mad endeavor will either work or he\u2019ll be dead, and his brave rebels with him. The man howls with rage and raises his ax to squash the unarmed ant before him. Fai catches hold of his breastplate, steps onto the sword handle jutting from his leg, and climbs him like a tree. From the surprised giant\u2019s shoulders, Fai launches himself at Riku\u2019s horse and lands astride its hind quarters. Before Riku can turn to wonder at his passenger, Fai has the general\u2019s own dagger at his throat. He presses his lips to the man\u2019s ear and hisses, \u201cI am willing to die for my people. Are you?\u201d \u201cLay down your weapons!\u201d It comes out as a squeak, but the closest lieutenant relays the order. Hoarse shouts from nearby officers echo the general\u2019s surrender. They are soon followed by the clatter of dropped spears and halberds. Fai can see the relief in the soldiers\u2019 eyes. They didn\u2019t want this fight any more than the farmers did. Perhaps some had cousins here, even brothers and sisters. The only difference between fighters and the farmers is whether they carry a halberd or a hoe. Fai escorts Riku to their hilltop camp while the farmers and soldiers turn to the work of gathering and burning their dead. It becomes a shared chore. Most of these soldiers were farmfolk once. It is an easy return to their roots. Instinctual and welcome. Only a few need to be bound and watched. The city-born officers, groomed from birth to serve the Draconic codes. Fai pitches in with his people, carting corpses with care, building pyres for their funeral rites. He works until dusk, until a scream from the hilltop sends him sprinting through the camp. He knocks down a woman bringing water to the wounded, barks a hasty apology, and continues running. Two more screams echo down from the hilltop before he gets there. Phaelin\u2019s final scream is cut off as Eun runs her blade across the merchant\u2019s throat. Blood gushes over Eun\u2019s knife hand and down the woman\u2019s plush ashfur coat. Her painted eyes lose their luster and the richest woman in the east topples onto the dirt. Nearby, Riku howls through his gag and struggles with his bonds. \u201cNo,\u201d growls Fai. \u201cThis is the way of revenge, not revolution.\u201d He points down the hillside at the toiling Volcai. \u201cOur numbers have already grown. Word is spreading.\u201d \u201cWhat better way than to write those words in blood? Let the Dracai read their doomed futures in freshly gutted entrails.\u201d Eun sinks her knife into the twitching woman\u2019s belly and opens her from flank to flank. Fai looks away as the gorge rises in his throat. Eun laughs as she kneels beside the general and cleans Phaelin\u2019s blood from her knife with Riku\u2019s cloak. \u201cToo disgusted to hear what she had to say?\u201d \u201cYou tortured her. She would have told you anything to make you stop.\u201d Eun stands and shrugs. \u201cSounded true to me.\u201d She recites a list of the names and homes of the Dracai that Phaelin had taken an interest in. There is a mischievous glint in her eye as she says the last name, having kept the best to last. \u201cDromai.\u201d The name is a slap to Fai\u2019s face. His scars burn hot in his flesh. \u201cYou know where she is?\u201d \u201cI told you there are many roads to Ashvahan, boy.\u201d She points her bloodied dagger at General Riku. \u201cThe trick is knowing who to kill to get there.\u201d (To be continued...)",

        "(Written by Kasharn Rao. Illustrations by Sam Yang) Lightning\u2026 Ice... Earth...The elements are entwined in turmoil.A seething storm rages throughout Enion, threatening to destroy Volthaven and its people.The very land itself is twisting and turning, as if awakening from a dark slumber, and unearthing ancient mysteries thought to be lost to the ages.The starry-eyed wayfarer Lexi has been tasked with leading a troupe of adventurers into the heart of Enion, to uncover the origin of this elemental frenzy.She is joined by the traveling bard Yorick - always searching for new stories, the gruff dwarven blacksmith Thawne - with a keen eye for craftsmanship, and the aspiring magician M\u0101ra - who has a flair for the dramatic.For weeks our heroes have braved the elements as they venture deeper into Enion, where secrets await them... Despite being used to the cold, Lexi couldn\u2019t help but feel a chill run up her spine as she gazed over the landscape. Floating mountains that had spent an eternity frozen solid had shaken off their frosty shell, projecting strange mechanical whirring sounds. The wind, normally brisk and flecked with snowflakes, had been whipped up into a frenzy of crackling energy. Seismic vibrations rattled throughout the region in an almost rhythmic pattern, emanating from the centre of the region. Enion was changing. Yorick noticed her concern, which was unusual for the adventure-thirsty wayfarer. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked. Lexi sighed. \u201cSomething just isn\u2019t right. I don\u2019t know what it is, but I am afraid for the people of Volthaven.\u201d He nodded. \u201cHopefully the answer lies at the very centre - Yvor\u2019s Peak.\u201d But what will we find there\u2026 she wondered to herself. The party gritted their teeth against hail and thunder as they trudged onward. The earth beneath their feet trembled, as patches of glowing symbols poked out of the soil. At last the shadow of Yvor\u2019s Peak loomed behind a wall of fog. \u201cCan you feel that?\u201d M\u0101ra whispered, shivering. The others halted as the air itself buzzed with static electricity, setting their nerves on end. \u201cCurious,\u201d murmured Lexi, lifting Voltaire, the silvery bow that marked her as a Wayfarer. She drew an arrow from her quiver and aimed high. Voltaire\u2019s bowstring hummed with tension. Lexi released the arrow and it soared into the mist, flashing with lightning and leaving a glowing aurora trail in its wake. They gasped as the mist broke away and Yvor\u2019s Peak was revealed. The entire mountain had been separated down the middle, as if a giant had ripped it in twain.   \u201cSo this must have been what was causing the quakes,\u201d Lexi exclaimed. \u201cBut what could possibly have enough strength to do this?\u201d Thawne shook his head. \u201cLook at the ridges. They\u2019re smooth. This mountain didn\u2019t just break apart. It was\u2026 built this way.\u201d Cautiously they ventured forth, avoiding whizzing boulders that orbited the mountain, propelled by the uncanny static aura. Coming closer they were able to gain a clearer view of the mountain\u2019s interior. The frosty layer that had once blanketed Yvor\u2019s Peak had now been dislodged, littering the ground with icy debris. Towering above it was a colossal stone statue - Lexi recognised it as the mythical Ancient of Thunder and Ice. The stone was pristine, having been encased within the mountain for thousands of years, hidden from the elements. \u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2026\u201d Lexi said. \u201cWhat is this place\u2026 and why has it revealed itself now?\u201d She gazed up at the statue, and couldn\u2019t help but feel the weight of responsibility on her usually carefree shoulders. Thawne let out a whoop of joy, pointing at the base of Yvor\u2019s staff. \u201cThat\u2019s a lever mechanism if I ever saw one,\u201d he yelled, and heaved at it, stout muscles straining. The others joined to help, and eventually the stone pommel grinded back a few feet, followed by a click. A deep rumbling echoed throughout the mountain as Yvor\u2019s statue began to rise. The party ran for shelter and watched in awe as the base of the statue twisted upwards. Finally it came to a halt, revealing a massive door. Symbols were etched into the doors' surface from some dialect lost to the ages. It took all of their combined strength to push the door open, revealing steps leading into darkness. M\u0101ra clicked her fingers, producing a dancing rainbow flame, and lit the way. The walls were adorned with metal gears, valves, and pipes, and every few moments a faint ticking sound could be heard. Eventually they came to a gigantic round chamber. Lexi felt like an insect as she walked past huge pillars, each sporting enormous metal hooks to store various huge weapons. \u201cIt\u2019s some kind of armoury!\u201d Thawne exclaimed, running to and fro like a child in a sweetshop. Lexi felt herself drawn to the centre, where a huge pedestal lay. Deep grooves ran down the pedestal, across the floor, and up the pillars, sparkling with a weak silvery glow. The pedestal itself contained a carved hole, perfect fit for a gem, coin, key, or some other small item. The hole was empty, and surrounded by the same strange text they had seen on the door. Yorick called them over to the walls of the chamber, which were sprawling with painted murals. Some of the pictures were intricate and beautiful, such as a blue crystalline maiden weaving ice and snow throughout what looked like Aria. Others were strange and outlandish, such as an enormous squid-like creature lurking within sunken ruins. And even more had a threatening and sinister feel, such as a blood-red dragon perched atop a mountain of skulls, surrounded by hellfire. Underneath each of the scenes was the same odd text. Lexi ran her palm over the wall. \u201cDo you recognise it?\u201d she asked Yorick hopefully. He shook his head, and produced a small leather tome from his pack, copying the inscriptions as M\u0101ra held the hovering flame above. When Yorick was done, they took one last long look at the chamber, then headed back out into the fray above.   Arriving back in Volthaven, Lexi watched as villagers frantically scurried to pack their belongings. Nobody had time to stop and chat, although they did send brief smiles her way. She noticed several homes crushed under the weight of an avalanche, or singed by lightning bolts. They made their way to the home of Isulvf, the oldest and wisest seer in the whole village. He ushered them into his hut out of the cold, and his eyes lit up when they told him what they had seen. Yorick handed him the leather tome. Isulvf scratched his head as he flicked through the pages, then sighed. \u201cThis writing\u2026 It's old. Possibly older than Volthaven itself. I do not know what it says.\u201d \u201cIs there anyone who might know?\u201d asked Lexi with a hint of desperation. He shook his head. \u201cNot here in Volthaven, that\u2019s certain.\u201d \u201cThen what do we do? Everything that\u2019s happening right now, it all seems to be connected to this writing.\u201d Isulvf hobbled over to the stovetop, pouring herbal tea for his guests. \u201cThere is a place far from here, where the elements converge, and fate behaves in a strange manner,\u201d he said, carrying the tray back to where they sat. \u201cMany old mystics, even before my time, used to make pilgrimages there to seek spiritual guidance.\u201d Lexi accepted the warm mug gratefully. \u201cPerhaps you should do the same.\u201d   Oldhim lumbered forwards like a relentless locomotive, completely ignoring the chaos around him. This road used to be quiet\u2026 He contemplated, as a merchant\u2019s caravan swerved to the side to avoid him, spilling a cart of fruit. With each heavy step his bulky frame slowly inched a little further, oblivious to the bustling traffic around him who were trying to head in the other direction. The more impatient caravan drivers would curse out - but fell silent when they caught sight of Oldhim, meekly veering off the road to move out of his way. Those who tried to push past him were flung off their horses as the beasts reared and bucked. Of all the looks they gave him - fear, awe, anger - he noticed none. Deep in thought, Oldhim nearly stepped upon a small crying child. For the first time since leaving his frozen slumber deep within Isenloft, Oldhim halted. The child stopped sniffling, gazing up at the oaken one in total shock. Everyone watched with bated breath, as Oldhim slowly reached within his robes. A woman burst forth to grab the child, her face pale with terror as the massive guardian bent down, peering at them with icy blue eyes. He withdrew his gloved fist, and opened it, revealing a tiny hand-knitted cotton toy. The child reached out with trembling hands, and clutched it close to her chest. An audible sigh of relief was heard, as the mother scampered away with the now-giggling child. Oldhim straightened his back, feeling the unkindness of age, and resumed plowing forwards. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d said an eager voice, to which Oldhim did not grace with a response. \u201cHello?\u201d The voice pestered again. Oldhim drowned it out by delving deep into ancient memories - war, bloodshed, the last desperate stand against the - \u201cHey!\u201d The voice broke through with such conviction that Oldhim stopped dead in his tracks and blinked in surprise. He glared at the bright-haired woman who had interrupted him, then caught sight of her gleaming bow. \u201cWayfarer.\u201d He murmured. She bowed. \u201cYou must not be from around here,\u201d she said. Oldhim grunted. \u201cAria has changed.\u201d He said gruffly. \u201cChanged? Do you remember a time when it was different?\u201d She asked. Oldhim stayed silent. She beckoned to one of her companions, a bard, who passed her a leather tome. \u201cPerhaps you recognise this?\u201d   Oldhim scanned the pages. The markings were old. Something about them felt familiar, but he couldn\u2019t grasp it. He shook his head, and continued walking. The wayfarer continued to skip alongside him, and much to his annoyance, the bard began playing an irritating tune on his lute. \u201cWhat brings you to the road to Korshem?\u201d Asked the wayfarer. \u201cAnswers.\u201d He replied. \u201cIt appears we have similar goals. My name is Lexi, perhaps we can travel together?\u201d Oldhim paused, then reached out and snatched the bard\u2019s lute. He hurled it through the air, where it shattered to splinters against a tree. \u201cNow you may join me.\u201d He growled, and strode onwards.   Lexi shrugged apologetically to Yorick, who grumbled and fell back to join the others. Lexi stayed at the frosty guardian\u2019s side, respectfully slowing herself to his pace.   \u201cFor the last time, it was an accident!\u201d Briar boiled with anger as she danced out of the path of swinging fists. The red-faced merchant continued to splutter as he punched wildly. The two circled each other, as spurts of lager bursting from a nearby keg rained down on them. Briar felt a small twinge of regret at having caused the wreckage, but it was quickly replaced by fury when the man clipped her shoulder with a right hook. It wasn\u2019t her fault. Nature was wild and so was she. Briar glanced at the ruined keg, which had been busted open by her wayward vines, then back at the sopping wet man attempting to clobber her. \u201cKeep this up and you\u2019ll wish the keg was the only thing broken,\u201d She hissed, drawing her Rosetta Thorn from its sheath. He continued to yell gibberish, and rushed at her. Red clouded Briar\u2019s judgment and she stepped back, splaying her palm. Roots burst from the earth, wrapping around the man\u2019s ankles, bringing him down like a felled tree. Briar rotated Rosetta Thorn, preparing to knock him out with its pommel, when an arrow whistled through the air, snaking between them, and thudding into the keg. A wave of cold spread from the arrows' tip, freezing the cracks, and reducing the torrent of lager to a foamy drizzle.   Briar stepped back in surprise. The source of the arrow, a woman with snowy hair and electric eyes, ran towards them, followed by the oddest bunch of people Briar had ever seen - including an enormous figure with a winter-white beard. The innkeeper took one glance at the stranger\u2019s glistening bow and cooled off immediately. She handed him some coins, and he waddled off. The woman turned to Briar, who scowled. \u201cIf it\u2019s thanks you\u2019re expecting wayfarer, then you\u2019re out of luck.\u201d The wayfarer shook her head. \u201cIt was my pleasure. But I do want to know where such a unique flower like yourself sprang from.\u201d Briar grimaced at the use of the term flower. \u201cI hail from Candlehold. I\u2019m the first of my kind to venture beyond the thorns since we were sealed away by the essence of Davnir.\u201d \u201cLove that for you,\u201d Said the wayfarer. \u201cI\u2019ve heard legends of the Ancients, Yvor, Davnir, Isen\u2026 Perhaps you may be able to help us after all.\u201d The wayfarer took a leather tome from one of her friends and showed it to her. Briar forced her temper into check and gazed at the pages. She did not recognise the markings, but there was something strange about them, like they were calling to her, drawing her in. She snapped the cover shut.   \u201cI have no idea.\u201d The wayfarer\u2019s face fell. Briar turned to leave but immediately bumped into the bearded giant, who searched her with his steely gaze for what felt like an eternity. \u201cRosetta,\u201d he finally mumbled. Briar turned back to the wayfarer. \u201cI may not be able to help you, but the queen of Candlehold is the wisest person I know.\u201d Sparks of joy returned to the wayfarer\u2019s face. \u201cFantastic! Could you lead us there?\u201d Briar marched off. \u201cFine. Keep up.\u201d The party followed Briar into the woods as dusk fell behind the branches of the legendary Korshem.   Yorick couldn\u2019t decide who was less fun - stone cold Oldhim, or Candlehold\u2019s sleepy queen. She sat perfectly still upon her wooden throne, face marbled like the tree-bark that surrounded her. In fact, if you didn\u2019t look hard enough, you would have missed spotting her completely.   Oldhim stood further back within the shade, as solemn as the grave. Neither would make an interesting character in his next play, Yorick decided. \u201cPlease, your majesty,\u201d begged Lexi. \u201cWe need to learn what the markings mean!\u201d \u201cHmm?\u201d The queen rasped, without moving even an inch to look at her. \u201cApologies dear, I must have dozed off again.\u201d \u201cOur people\u2019s safety depends on it - all of Aria could depend on it!\u201d \u201cLike one blade of grass in a meadow...\u201d The queen trailed off, not bothering to finish her sentence. Lexi exhaled in frustration. Oldhim stepped closer, scanning the queen\u2019s restful face. \u201cMy memory is\u2026 clouded,\u201d he muttered. \u201cBut the Rosetta\u2026 The Ollin...\u201d If the queen was surprised by his presence, she showed no signs of it. \u201cOllin...\u201d She murmured. \u201cYou\u2019ve been gone a long time.\u201d Oldhim\u2019s brow creased as he tried to recall what had been lost to the passage of time. \u201cThe Covenant\u2026 what happened?\u201d A long silence filled the room. When the queen finally spoke, her voice was soft, but with a hint of sadness. \u201c...I do not have the answers you seek.\u201d The queen idly waved a hand, signalling for them to leave. Briar hurled a bolt of lightning at her. Jolted awake, the queen blinked as Briar stomped towards the throne. \u201cThe trees rustle as if nervous. Animals are abandoning their homes. Something is coming, and I fear Candlehold will not be able to remain hidden. There\u2019s a reason the wayfarer and I crossed paths, I can feel the Strale calling.\u201d There was a creaking sound as the queen tilted her head to look at Briar directly. Though her face was wizened and hardened, her eyes were kind. \u201cI will try\u2026\u201d she croaked, gently rubbing her eyes. Lexi handed her the leather tome, and they waited impatiently as the queen turned each page with a deliberate slowness.   At last the queen glanced up, and closed the tome. \u201cThis dialect is of the Seers.\u201d Oldhim\u2019s ears pricked up. Handing the tome back to Lexi, the queen leaned back in her throne, yawning. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Lexi frowned in confusion. \u201cWe have seers in Volthaven, but they were not able to decipher it.\u201d The queen chuckled, a sound similar to that of a snoring toad. \u201cNot those seers\u2026 the Seers\u2026 of old. \u201cI don\u2019t understand, who were the old Seers?\u201d \u201cHidden allies\u2026 Bearers of the Indigo Eye\u2026 Find them\u2026 If they still exist.\u201d \u201cAny idea where we might start looking?\u201d asked Lexi. The queen closed her eyes, and exhaled deeply, sinking further into the wood.   Back under Korshem\u2019s sprawling canopy, the heroes washed their worries away at a nearby tavern. Yorick tuned his new lute, keeping well away from Oldhim, and began strumming an enchanting melody. Thawne and Briar were locked in an arm-wrestle, beads of sweat rolling down the dwarf\u2019s forehead as he strained to out-muscle her. M\u0101ra performed a magic trick for Oldhim, producing a dove from her sleeve. With an extravagant wave of her hand she transformed it into a dazzling rainbow aether flare. The oaken one did not crack even the slightest of grins. Lexi wandered away from the party, her mind racing with questions. Where were the Seers? Why was there an armoury in the heart of Enion? What did it all mean? Her eyes were drawn to a poster tacked on a nearby wall. Challenge the Showstopper to a test of might!Experience crazy brews from Aria\u2019s finest Braumeister!Have your fate foreseen by the whimsical seers!All this and many more wonders - see it all at Everfest!   She snatched the poster and returned to the group, slapping it on the table. \u201cLook!\u201d she pointed. Yorick rolled his eyes. \u201cYes, because an ancient secret organisation just happens to be conveniently advertising their location on a carnival poster.\u201d \u201cAny better ideas?\u201d Nobody responded except Briar, who just shrugged and went back to crushing Thawne\u2019s arm. Lexi lifted her mug. \u201cThen drink up, friends! Tomorrow we set foot for Everfest!\u201d",
        "Dangerous Fauna: The bestiary notes from Scarborough\u2019s work detail an even more horrifying reality. From great, scaled beasts with dripping fangs, to creatures with crystalline skin and serrated limbs, the creatures in the Savage Lands seem to be nothing short of lethal. Elite predators and monstrous beasts populate the jungle, striking down their prey with deadly accuracy, tearing apart their prey to glean every last scrap of muscle and marrow; their gaping maws drip with blood, beady eyes gleaming in the dark as they devour the raw flesh of their prey. In the shadows behind them, small scavengers lurk, waiting for the opportunity to pick apart the remains for scraps of muscle and marrow.",
        "(Written by Nicola Price, edited by Tarryn Thomas, with illustrations by Iain Miki.)  Levia was born into poverty, her impoverished family one of many who worked for the nobility of the Northern Realms. Her father had been a stablehand for Lord Barthimont, but he disappeared suddenly when Levia was very young, leaving his family destitute. Without the means to support herself and her daughter, Levia\u2019s mother sold them both into the service of the Barthimont estate, an act borne of desperation.   Levia remembered little of her mother, who was forced to spend long hours serving Lady Barthimont. She would leave their shared bed shortly before first light, and would return long after the candles had extinguished themselves. Once, several years after they\u2019d come to live at the estate, Levia\u2019s mother woke her in the early hours of the morning, her face drawn with terror as she begged her daughter not to trust the Barthimonts and to flee their holdings as soon as she had an opportunity to escape.   Several days later her mother vanished, leaving Levia with only that last haunting, cryptic warning. However, she refused to heed her mother\u2019s words. Stubborn, strong-willed, and resolved to uncover the truth, she instead decided to investigate and explore the deepest, darkest corners of the castle. As Levia grew older and more determined, the Barthimont estate descended ever deeper into madness. The servants fought over scraps of food while the nobles dined on elaborate feasts, Lord Barthimont\u2019s hunting trips took him further and further from his lands, and all the while, Lady Barthimont only seemed to thrive on the bitter emotions which flooded the manor.   On one of Levia\u2019s late-night walks through the mansion, she heard a shrill, piercing scream, distant and muffled; the sound of pure, unadulterated horror. Resolute, she wandered in the direction of the sound, searching for answers\u2014and later, a part of her would wish that she had never found them. Through the keyhole of a solid oaken door, Levia glimpsed the walls of a room, painted a deep, dark, congealing crimson. The stained rugs were littered with scraps of parchment, and a pale, wizened hand grasped at a woman\u2019s immaculately pressed skirts. Lady Barthimont\u2019s laughter was clearly audible through the wood as a faint glow crept through the chamber, illuminating the indecipherable symbols carved into the floor at her feet. Even through the door Levia could feel the swell of energy in the room, humming like the air before a thunderstorm. The sigils at the woman\u2019s feet lit up one by one, flooding the room with a crimson light. As the one directly beneath her feet caught flame, the bodies of her servants were illuminated by a violent, crimson light, casting Lady Barthimont\u2019s shadow along the length of the floor. With a satisfied sigh, she fell upon the servants and began to devour them in a fervid frenzy, spraying a fine mist of blood across the room, face streaked with blood and viscera.   Fear seized Levia\u2019s lungs in an icy grip, squeezing the breath from her chest\u2014but as she stumbled back, she felt the fierce burning of a deep rage course through her veins. While the sight of the servants\u2019 mangled, butchered corpses had disgusted Levia, a part of her cried out in hunger. This was perhaps her one and only path to power; her only opportunity to take charge of her own fate, lest she end up like them. The following months found her back at Lady Barthimont\u2019s doors, closely studying the dark rituals that were taking place within. She steeled her stomach against the helpless cries, the glistening of viscera in the low light, the gleeful expression on her mistress\u2019s face as she slaughtered Levia\u2019s fellow servants. Her focus narrowed to a razor\u2019s edge, Levia looked upon the rituals and learned. Under the cover of darkness, Levia slipped outside the castle walls, clutching a stolen dagger to her chest. With barely a whisper, she spilled her blood onto the sigils which encircled her, painstakingly recreating Lady Barthimont\u2019s ritual in order to call upon the power of the beyond. That night, for the first time, Levia tasted the power of the Shadows for herself, as sweet as the first sip of water to a man dying of thirst. It blossomed within her chest, awakening a deep, insatiable hunger for more. For months Levia sought that feeling, that single taste, in search of a way to quell the hunger within. She hunted small animals in the dead of night, sacrificing their writhing bodies for the sake of her dark rituals, mindless and unyielding in her quest for supremacy. Even as the estate transformed around her, Levia took no notice; she remained oblivious to the disappearance of her fellow servants, to the vanishing of Lord Barthimont himself, and took no notice of the new guests who began arriving at the estate. While she served them, bringing the nobility anything they requested, Levia\u2019s focus was solely on her own quest for power. One evening, just as the candles began to sputter, she found herself summoned to the great hall, where Lady Barthimont was hosting noble guests for the evening. Twelve servants in all, they entered through the main doors to find the room to be empty; empty, save for the banquet which lay before them.   Great, glistening roast meats; piles of baked vegetables; baskets of fresh bread; goblets filled to the brim with dark, red wine; tiny cakes decorated with candied fruit and nuts; salted caramels wrapped in wax paper. Even from a distance, Levia could smell the spices and fresh herbs, the salted beef and rich gravy. As the other servants looked around for the lords and ladies, one of the youngest servants stepped forward. His eyes locked onto the nearest basket of buttery biscuits, he stretched out a hand to take one and quietly began to eat. When the other servants rushed forward, a booming thunderclap echoed through the room. The doors around them slammed shut, one by one, and a quiet series of clicks confirmed the sound of the keys turning in their locks. When the last door was secured, a curtain above them slid back to reveal the nobility, perched in a viewing gallery just above. Looking up at them, Levia caught a glimpse of Lady Barthimont\u2019s pleased smirk. Her eyes were gleaming in the candlelight like fragments of steel, her canines bared in an expression of anticipatory delight; she was a wolf who had cornered its prey, and now prepared itself for a feast. A horrific, droning reverberation flooded the room, driving many of the servants to their knees. The walls ran red with blood, dripping scarlet stains onto the floor. The terrified screams of the other servants echoed off the walls as they collapsed, their bodies beginning to dissolve, melting into rancid puddles of flesh and blood. The smell of their burning marrow seared the back of Levia\u2019s throat, her very bones vibrating as her skin began to boil and her legs trembled beneath her.   Painfully aware of the fate which awaited them all, she reluctantly succumbed to her need to survive and enacted the final, terrible price of the rituals she\u2019d learned from her mistress. With a bellowing cry, she crawled forward and lunged at the nearest body, tearing its flesh away in strips and cramming the raw meat into her open mouth. Her mind turned grey with smoke, her consciousness detaching from the gore which surrounded her. Through a veil of wine-dark mist, she glimpsed a dark entity, surrounded by an endless sea of crimson and ivory, its gaping maw lined with hundreds of massive fangs. As the beast drew nearer to her, the dim light revealed the rotting flesh clinging to its mutated body, marred by blood and acid bile. Great tendrils peeling off its back writhed, striking out at the shadows. Its clawed hands reached towards her, tentacles creeping along the stone floor like the roots of the darkness itself, and Levia was quick to dodge its slashing attack, ears ringing with the echoes of the creature\u2019s guttural roar. She threw herself at the beast, feeling her bloodlust spill over into an all-consuming sea of red. Through the haze she could barely see the creature before her, and blindly lashed out at its altered form. She felt its flesh tear beneath her talons, heard its screech rippling through the air, smelled the molten, ink-black blood which spilled forth from its injuries; she could almost taste its acrid bile on the back of her tongue. The marble floor caved in under the weight of her body, stone tiles cracking as Levia leapt back, landing on her feet. As her bloodlust finally began to fade, she became aware of the blood and viscera coating her skin; she looked down at the weight in her left hand, and met the blank-eyed stare of Lady Barthimont\u2019s disembodied head. For the first time in months, the great hall was completely silent, stained red from the carnage which surrounded her.   At last, Levia has been released from her erstwhile mistress\u2019s control, and is finally free to decide her own fate. However, the strength she now wields has come at a terrible price. Once someone has sacrificed a living being, the grip of the Shadows is as iron. Levia is compelled to follow the whims of a creature from the beyond, succumbing to her base instinct to destroy and consume. Now that she has been released from the Barthimonts\u2019 clutches, Levia refuses to let anybody else control her ever again.",
        "Born the daughter of a noble house in the Northern Realms, the future Lady Barthimont was raised with the grace and cunning expected of a woman of her rank. Once she had come of age, her father quickly found a match for her, marrying her to another Lord in order to secure the power and status that he felt his daughter rightfully deserved. But when Lady Barthimont had moved to her new estate with her servants in tow, expecting a life of luxury and comfort, she was faced with a harsh reality. Lord Barthimont was lazy, dull and impassive; he gallivanted across the plains with his hunting parties, his inexperienced new wife to take over the running of the estate in his absence, toiling over paperwork and engaging in empty pleasantries with unwanted visitors. Over the years, as she watched her youth wither away, she grew ever more embittered by her absent husband and the mundane, maddening work he left her to face alone. This continued until one very ordinary day, when a visitor to Lady Barthimont\u2019s hall brought her an intriguing gift; a grimoire of mysterious origin. The tome had clearly changed hands many times, its dark leather cover worn by the touch of its past owners. Within this grimoire, she experienced her first introduction to the Shadow\u2014an arcane art which promised her the kind of power she\u2019d always dreamt of wielding. Delving into its depths, she quickly discovered her arcane gifts, a connection to the aether which she found blossoming within her day by day. As her talents grew, so did her hunger for power. Lady Barthimont began to draw upon the resources made available through her aristocratic status, sacrificing the blood of her servants in fiendish rituals, spending her fortune on sourcing arcane artefacts from across the continent, and inviting other practitioners among the nobility into her home. In this way, her lavish parties formed the basis for gaining more and more knowledge, and eventually she found exactly what she\u2019d been searching for. Lady Barthimont decided that she would seek to call upon an entity from the beyond, who could imbue her with its own power, and allow her to bend all others to her will. Yet before she could move into the final phase of her plans, they were overturned, and one of her own traitorous servants stole the power for her own. The final indignity was dying by the young woman\u2019s hands, strangled by the very might she had sought for herself.

        "(Art of Nikolay Moskvin) The heartlands of Aria are painted with vast swaths of forests. Crystalline trees glimmer under the rainbow glow of the Flow, as beautiful Cesari and all manner of wondrous creatures dance amongst the trees. These woods had borne witness to countless stories and legends throughout the Ages, as the once arid badlands was transformed into the sanctuary that it is today by the remnants of the Ancients\u2019 power. It is within these woods that the enclave of Candlehold lay hidden, surrounded by the thick walls of bramble and thorn that separated it from the rest of Aria. And it is here that the Queen of Candlehold drifted in and out of her timeless slumber, as her dreams took her back to the Third Age, and the horrors that befell her people. At the height of battle, Davnir, Ancient of Earth and Lightning, was struck down in front of her very eyes. Her people were once powerful scholars that stood alongside the likes of the Ollin and the Seers, but their ranks quickly crumbled without Davnir by their side. As her brothers and sisters fell all around her, in a final act of desperation, she ignited the essence of their fallen protector, and unleashed its full potential in reckless abandon. The power of Earth and Lightning converged all around her in a violent storm, erupting in an overwhelming torrent as it ravaged the land, and transformed its inhabitants. Her people would be saved, but salvation had come at a hefty price... They had melded with the volatile energy of Davnir, a power borne from her own reckless spell. They had become one with these enchanting woods. The days came and went in an endless stream, as time itself began to lose its meaning. An eternity passed before the Queen stirred from her slumber, and an eternity more, before she mustered up the strength to free herself free from her leafy \u201cthrone\u201d. She had become one with Candlehold; its charge, its carer, and its prisoner. But with an incredible force of will she tore herself out of its warm embrace, for her people needed her now more than ever. Slowly, she gathered their drifting spirits, and infused them within the seeds that grew atop her mighty throne. With great patience and perseverance she weaved the essence of Davnir over them, and for many long seasons nurtured them with her mighty magic... until the day came when she would set them free, to begin their life anew. And on that day the Queen spread her arms, and the quiet breeze scattered the seeds all over this peaceful enclave. They would land upon pristine pastures or amongst fields of flowers, and sprout and grow into mighty trees! And one by one her brothers and sisters returned; they had become Wardens of the grove where they laid down their roots. But they too were trapped here by the power of Davnir, and could do naught but chew over the days within this timeless paradise. * * * * * In a dark, lonely corner, a little seed pulsed and throbbed amongst the thick bramble as it struggled to lay down its roots. She had drifted far upon gusts of wind, carried by creatures of the forest, and by some cruel twist of fate or perhaps great fortune, fell upon this most inhospitable of groves at the outer edges of Candlehold. The thick vines and brambles that grew here had protected Candlehold throughout the Ages, while the Queen lay drifting within her peaceful slumber. In time they covered the earth and the sky with their gnarly, twisting form, and warded off all that would encroach upon these lands. They were the little seed\u2019s greatest foe as they greedily lapped up the energy of Davnir that flowed from the heart of Candlehold, leaving her to wither all on her lonesome. But she was resilient. She was tough. In the face of these giants she stood her ground. And in time, planted her roots deep into the earth. The days blended into weeks, and years, until an elder noticed her peeking out from within the overgrowth. The Queen, her heart broke for the poor child, and she sent her best shamans to aid it the best they could. They rained healing waters down upon her, and infused her with the essences of Earth and Lightning. With their help, she began to thrive. Until at long last it was her turn to bloom. She took the name of Briar, the wild rose that sprung forth from amongst the bramble. And all of Candlehold rejoiced, as the last of their sisters returned to them. But Briar was unlike her brothers and sisters. She was tough and hardy like the brambles that blotted out the skies of her youth. And though they were kind to her and welcomed her as one of their own, she felt most at ease amongst the thorns and brambles of her grove. Her old nemesis, the vines, had become her greatest mentor and friend, as they sparred and tussled in the thick overgrowth. And from within the brambles\u2019 freshest heartwoods she drew forth her blade, that would cement her as a Warden of her grove. As she took up her blade, an incredible yet foreign power coursed through her. Her grove was indeed unlike any throughout the rest of Candlehold, for these vines and bramble that protected Candlehold drew their power from both the essence of Davnir, and the Flow that permeated the rest of Aria. It was a perfect conduit out of the heartlands; she alone could break the grip of Davnir's mighty essence, and escape into the outside world. Over the Ages, her brothers and sisters had become content within their slice of paradise. They would spend their days lounging about under the lazy sun, as they became more and more like the woods that surrounded them. But Briar was filled with a desire to move, to spread her roots far and wide. She would be the first of the Rosetta to set foot outside Candlehold since the time of the Ancients, bringing with her the tidings of her people, and the start of a brand new adventure.",

        "The imperial guards ushered him into the room, the Lord Wizard Chiyo close behind. As she stepped in front of him, the members of the Chamber of the Dragon all turned, looking down at the scene before them. Clearing her throat, the Lord Wizard turned her gaze to the Lord Chancellor himself.   \u201cNot five minutes ago, I heard a commotion in the halls of the inner palace. When I found the source of the noise, I found this young wizard standing over Lord Wizard Akihiko\u2019s body.\u201d A low murmur rolled through the room as every member of the Chamber began to speak at once, turning to quietly address their neighbours. The Lord Chancellor held up one hand, immediately silencing all those present. The Lord Chancellor was dressed in the elaborate garb of the Chamber of the Dragon, adorned in clothes of black and gold. His snow-white hair was drawn up into a metal hairpiece, depicting three ryoki leaping in and out of a stream of lava. Framed by prominent cheekbones, his eyes were startlingly bright for his age, a keen gaze landing on the young wizard before him. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d \u201cKano. Lord Chancellor-\u201d \u201cYou were found standing over the corpse of your former mentor. Is that correct?\u201d \u201cYes-\u201d \u201cAnd you were the one who killed him?\u201d Kano paused, gathering his thoughts. \u201cHe led me into a section of the palace where no one else was present, and then attacked me. I was acting out of self-defense.\u201d \u201cYou want us to believe that a Lord Wizard - one who mentored you, I might add - attacked you within the halls of the inner palace?\u201d \u201cI know how it sounds.\u201d Kano stretched his hands out before him, palms up. \u201cBut believe me, I don\u2019t have any reason to attack him. When I met the Lord Wizard Akihiko earlier, he wasn\u2019t acting like himself.\u201d The Lord Chancellor gazed down at him steadily, keen gaze fixed on Kano as he thought. Finally, with a wave of his hand, he motioned for Kano to continue speaking. \u201cWe were discussing my Trial of Embers,\u201d he continued, neatly skipping the part where they discussed his cheating, \u201cand we happened to begin discussing aether. I mentioned that the aether in Volcor felt unstable recently, as if something had thrown it out of balance. The Lord Wizard reacted as if I\u2019d attacked him. Then, suddenly, decided we had to speak to the Chamber of the Dragon. He led me down into the inner palace, completely silent, and just as I began to suspect that something was wrong, he attacked me. As I was attempting to defend myself, I cast an attack back at him, which the Lord Wizard did not deflect or dodge. Almost immediately, smoke began to pour from his nose and ears. His skin turned grey, his eyes were sunken in - the man looked like a corpse. Even after revoking the flames, he was still writhing on the floor and smoking, and then very suddenly, he was dead. Just like that.\u201d Taking a breath, Kano nodded to the Lord Wizard Chiyo and the imperial guards behind her. \u201cAsk them what he looked like. They\u2019ll tell you the exact same thing.\u201d The Lord Chancellor turned his gaze to the Lord Wizard Chiyo, raising his eyebrows expectantly. \u201cHe\u2026 is technically correct. When I arrived, I did notice that something felt off about the Lord Wizard\u2019s appearance, but that could also be because of Kano\u2019s interference. I could tell that he cast some kind of spell before I found him; that could be responsible for the physical condition of the Lord Wizard. However, the Lord Wizard was already in the process of burning by the time I arrived, and there is too much damage to the body to confirm Kano\u2019s account.\u201d \u201cKano,\u201d The Lord Chancellor began, voice heavy with warning. \u201cYour account implies that you used only your inherent fire magic. If Chiyo is correct, and you cast an aetheric spell, the Chamber requires that information.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Kano admitted, one eyebrow raised, \u201cI did cast a spell - but that had nothing to do with the Lord Wizard\u2019s appearance. I interrupted his magic with a spell that temporarily severs a person\u2019s connection to arcane energy.\u201d The room broke into murmurs once again, only quieting when the Lord Chancellor intervened. \u201cThis spell would have prevented Akihiko from casting magic?\u201d \u201cYes - but only aetheric spells. It doesn\u2019t affect innate fire magic. Or at least, it didn\u2019t when I was testing the spell.\u201d The Lord Chancellor sighed deeply, rubbing a hand over his forehead. \u201cI open the floor to the Chamber at large.\u201d \u201cThis is preposterous.\u201d One of the grand strategists, a large man by the name of Daijo, rose from his seat, pointing down at Kano. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard of this young man before. He has a reputation for trickery and lies - we have no reason to believe him.\u201d   \u201cI concur with Daijo-\u201d \u201cRemember when Kano-\u201d \u201c-it took weeks for the stone to-\u201d \u201c-he almost ruined-\u201d \u201c-cannot believe we\u2019re even considering-!\u201d The hall burst into a cacophony of voices as the Chamber of the Dragon began to speak all at once, speaking over one another, voices raised as several members rose from their chairs. The Lord Chancellor looked increasingly unhappy as the counselors argued, bringing up long-forgotten insults, slights, and past trickery. Kano watched on silently, brow furrowed. With Akihiko\u2019s corpse marred by burns, it was going to be difficult to convince them that something else had happened to the Lord Wizard, something that he himself barely understood. Kano thought back on the second before Akihiko attacked him, remembering the pallor to his skin, his sunken eyes and bared teeth. The man had seemed almost as if he was, on some level, already dead. He still wasn\u2019t sure how it had happened. The Lord Wizard Akihiko had seemed perfectly healthy when Kano first met with him that morning, so it had to have either come on very quickly, or something had to have hidden the Lord Wizard\u2019s condition. But why? If it was a spell, like the Lord Wizard Chiyo suspected, then someone could have possibly hidden the effects from view, but Akihiko himself would have still noticed what was happening to his own body. Even so, Kano couldn\u2019t help but feel that Chiyo was on the right track, judging by the way that Akihiko reacted to his spell earlier. Looking around the hall, Kano gazed at the members of the Chamber of the Dragon. While many were busy discussing or arguing the matter of Kano\u2019s involvement, he noticed that the Grand Strategist Daijo seemed more emphatic than the rest, veins bulging in his neck as he shouted. For a moment, it reminded him of Lord Wizard Akihiko\u2019s sudden aggression earlier. Kano frowned thoughtfully, thinking back on what the Lord Wizard Chiyo said. While it hadn\u2019t been his intention, his spell could have possibly caused the changes to his body - by exposing what was already there. If there had been an arcane cause for Lord Wizard Akihiko\u2019s ailment, his spell might have interrupted the flow of aether just enough to reveal Akihiko\u2019s condition. \u201cThat\u2019s why he reacted to my comment about aether,\u201d Kano muttered. \u201cThere\u2019s a link.\u201d Raising his head, he looked to the Lord Chancellor, who was attempting to bring order back to the Chamber of the Dragon. As it stood, even the Lord Wizard next to him had been drawn into the argument, her focus entirely on the other members of the chamber. Neither were looking at Kano, and as he looked around at the chamber, he got an idea. Calling aether into his grasp, Kano subtly began to work the same spell as earlier. If what had happened to Lord Wizard Akihiko was happening to anyone else, this could possibly expose it; and at the very least, the wizards among the Chamber would take note of an interruption to the aether around them. Weaving the spell into being, Kano gave breath to the incantation, flicking the arcane energy out with his fingertips. The spell snapped across the room, striking the wizards among them with a slap. Some, however, reacted more strongly than others, and as the wizards of the room turned toward Kano, indignation on their faces, Kano looked over the members of the chamber in shock. Almost a third of the Chamber were frozen in place, staring blankly into mid-air. As one, their faces drained of colour, exposing the bruised veins lying beneath their skin. Their lips turned blue, cheeks gaunt, as every pair of unseeing eyes turned to stare at Kano with the gaze of a blizzard; ice-cold, empty and howling. The Lord Chancellor, for his part, caught on quickly, gazing around the room with horror dawning on his face. One by one, the other members of the Chamber began to realise what was happening, turning to look at their neighbours with expressions of alarm. Next to him, he heard the Lord Wizard Chiyo\u2019s sharp inhale.   The tension in the room reached a tipping point, a moment of silence reigning as everyone froze in place. Kano watched as the grand strategist Daijo stared down at him, his dark expression morphing into a snarl, and with an ear-splitting shriek, he leapt forward. As Daijo attacked, all of the others snapped out of their trance, turning on their former colleagues with screams and howls. The room broke into complete chaos, the wizards among them calling on their innate fire, as the grand strategists and lord generals drew their blades. Before Daijo even reached Kano, the Lord Wizard Chiyo stepped in, shooting a wave of fire at the grand strategist. The flames poured from her hands, covering Daijo completely and setting him alight. As he began to shriek, smoke pouring from his ears and nose, something flew out from his open mouth. A tiny, ink-black creature collided with the floor, no longer or thicker than Kano\u2019s little finger. Shining in the light of the flames, it went still, evaporating into black smoke a second later. With a flourish, Kano ignited the air around him, allowing the fire to burn brighter and brighter, forming a pillar of white-hot flames. Another counselor of the Chamber came running at Kano, a dagger in his hand. With a wave of his hand, Kano set the man alight, stopping him just shy of attacking. A quick glance proved that the rest of the room had broken into a full battle, as the remaining members of the Chamber tried to stop their attackers. The Lord Chancellor backed away from the podium, several of the ministers stepping in to form a barrier between the Chancellor and the afflicted. Just as Kano stepped forward, fire at the ready, he was halted by a deep rumble in the air.  A dragon\u2019s roar, unmistakable in its power and intensity, sounded through the hall, vibrating through the air with the force of a thunderclap. The very floor beneath their feet shook with its power, as the aether around them stirred at its call. Instantaneously, each of the changed counselors burst into flame. One by one, they collapsed to the floor, smoke pouring from their burning bodies, their combined shrieks climbing higher in pitch until finally, they were unable to be heard at all. At last, there was silence, the last of the afflicted expiring in a puff of ash. The gilded panel at the very back of the hall opened, its golden surface opening to reveal the resplendent uniforms of the Emperor\u2019s personal guard. Stepping out and to the side, they parted to reveal the Emperor himself, the Empress at his side. His robes were scarlet trimmed with gold, partially hidden beneath grand ceremonial armour, resembling the scales of the great dragon itself. His shoulders were covered by great pauldrons, tipped with an obsidian claw, opening into a cloak made to resemble dragon wings. His hair was barely visible behind his headdress, a plume of gilded dragonsfire, the point of each flame crowned with enchanted vuurlin feathers. A mask covered his face from view, sculpted from obsidian and gold to form the face of a dragon. Through the gaps in the mask, his eyes were just barely visible, almost appearing to glow. At his side, the Empress was similarly dressed, her elaborate crimson dress framed in dragon armour. A cloak hung from her great shoulder pauldrons, framing her dress in ink-black silk, gold embroidery shining at the edges of the fabric. Lava crystals were embedded in her grand hairpiece, interspersed with great plumes of enchanted fire. Their entourage entered just behind them, made smaller by comparison, their heads bowed in deference. One by one, the members of the chamber followed suit, quickly falling to their knees before the figure of their Emperor. From where he kneeled, Kano could see the Lord Chancellor\u2019s profile, watching as the man\u2019s expression revealed his growing panic. Even as the Lord Chancellor made to speak, the Emperor waved a hand, instantly silencing him. For a long moment, nobody in the room dared to breathe. The Empress at his side was unreadable behind her half-mask, cool and collected next to the Emperor\u2019s rage. At his signal, imperial guards entered, gathering the scattered remains of the afflicted counselors. The remaining members of the Chamber of the Dragon watched on silently, expressions carefully blank, but tension clear in the set of their shoulders. Rising from his position on the floor, the Lord Chancellor kept his head bowed, silently following the Emperor and Empress back into the passageway. The entourage blocked them from view as they retreated into the inner palace, the gilded panel sliding shut behind them.   For almost two days, Kano heard nothing further, excluded from the Chamber of the Dragon\u2019s discussions. Finally, someone came to collect him, his uniform identifying him as one of the imperial family\u2019s personal retinue. With some amount of apprehension, Kano followed him down into the innermost sanctum of the palace.   The guard led him into a hidden room, its doorway masked by the panels decorating the halls. It was almost indistinguishable from its surroundings, unless you knew exactly where to look. The guard remained standing nearby, staring directly ahead, waiting. Kano looked at the room around him, choosing to remain standing. The seconds stretched into minutes, time crawling slowly by as Kano waited. Based solely on the man who came to collect him, and the location of the room they were in now, he suspected he was meeting a member of the immediate imperial family. The better question was why a member of the imperial family would want to speak to him. Finally, the panel slid open, revealing two more guards from the imperial family\u2019s personal retinue. They parted to reveal the head of the Alshoni faction, Lord Wizard and cousin to the Emperor, accompanied by the Lord Chancellor. As she took a seat, he motioned for Kano to do the same. A long moment passed as she remained silent, her gaze fixed on the younger wizard, something thoughtful lingering in her expression. \u201cAlmost a year ago, the Chamber of the Dragon discovered that one of the lord generals had been - for lack of a better word - possessed. Several of the lord wizards studied his corpse and found that an unknown creature had taken control of his body, and that its presence caused a number of issues, including tissue death. They uncovered several more of these creatures inside the royal court, and removed each of them. The lord wizards have continued to monitor the court since then, and after a time, these creatures stopped appearing.\u201d The Lord Wizard Yama paused, motioning to the Lord Chancellor at her side. \u201cThe Lord Chancellor reported that the creatures had been eradicated, and while we hadn\u2019t uncovered where the creatures came from, we decided to put our focus onto the matter of aether. The Lord Chancellor mentioned that you expressed concerns about aether stability, so I assume you\u2019ve also noticed a change in the aether across Volcor?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Kano replied, looking between the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Wizard. \u201cI noticed that the aether across Volcor has been more unstable in the last few years. When I saw that some wizards were struggling to control their fire magic, I suspected that the two might be related.\u201d Yama nodded. \u201cThe cause is an aetheric imbalance, which has been disturbing aetheric spells in Volcor for almost a decade. However, more recently, it has also been causing problems with basic fire magic - which should be unaffected by aether. We decided to put our focus into solving the issue, not realising that the creatures we discovered had begun to mutate, and found new ways to go unnoticed. Thanks to your encounter with Lord Wizard Akihiko, we have uncovered more of these impostors, and are training others in a spell to detect their presence. It is my understanding that you have yet to receive a title. The Emperor himself has decided to create one for you, thanks in part to your role in uncovering the creatures within our court.\u201d At her signal, one of the guards produced a staff, carved from pure obsidian to resemble a dragon, a crystal floating just within reach of its open maw. \u201cThe Dracai of Aether, while a gift, does not come without responsibility. The Council of the Dragon wants you to look into the aetheric disturbance. Just as you uncovered the creatures, we would like you to uncover the truth behind what is happening to our wizards, and find a way to reverse the change. You yourself just spoke about your affinity with aether. We believe that this gives you a unique ability to uncover more about the aether imbalance.\u201d Taking the staff from the guard, she stood, hands outstretched, offering the staff to Kano.   \u201cThis is the Crucible of Aetherweave, an heirloom which was once gifted to your ancestor by the past Emperor. Accept this, and you accept your role as the Dracai of Aether.\u201d Rising from his seat, Kano stared down at the staff before him, looking over the carved obsidian scales. He could feel the enchanted crystal even at a distance, an eternal flame dancing within. After a long moment, he grinned, reaching out to accept the staff from the Lord Wizard Yama. In his hands, the staff appeared to awaken, firelight dancing between the obsidian scales. He felt the aether around him in stir in response, arcane energy channeling through the core of the staff. With a laugh, he nodded, straightening. \u201cDracai of Aether. I like the sound of that.\u201d",
        "Illustrations by MJ Fetesio, colour by Sindy Wo, story by Nicola Price.   Centuries after the end of the great wars, Solana is experiencing an era of peace and prosperity, with the last of its great defenses completed, and its people watched over by noble protectors. And yet, a strange wind has begun to stir once more, sowing seeds of unrest across the continent. Strangers hail from the East, bringing their strange customs and mystic rites to the outskirts of the grand city. To the South, blasphemous cults gather, driven by greed and gluttony. Worst of all, the savage packs of the west gather near the outskirts of the jungle, creeping ever closer to the villages under Solana\u2019s protection. Amidst the brewing storm, the Hand of Sol gathers in ever larger patrols, permanently stationing knights in villages across the golden fields. As terrible beasts begin to emerge, Solana\u2019s scholars continue to search for a possible cause, and a way to eliminate the creatures once and for all. The knights of the Hand of Sol are needed now more than ever, to defend innocent lives from the horrors that threaten to overwhelm them all.  Childhood For centuries, the Ironsong family have prided themselves on their reputation as master blacksmiths. The first generation of the bloodline were awarded the name of Ironsong for their work with weapons and armour, forging some of the finest in all of Solana. In the years since, they have passed down their trade secrets from generation to generation, preserving the Ironsong name. Dorinthea Ironsong was an only child with a penchant for mischief. Her earliest memories are of the forge, and the heavy scent of smoke hanging in the air as she watched her parents work, expertly crafting graceful blades and sun-blessed shields. Her mother would often talk to her while smithing, explaining everything to her curious daughter. When she wasn\u2019t in the forge with her parents, Thea could usually be found with Minerva, the reserved, steely-eyed woman who ran the Golden Chariot next to the Ironsong forge. Her parents had known Minerva since they were children, long since passing the line between friends and family. While Thea knew that Minerva had been born outside of Solana, the innkeeper was incredibly private, and rarely spoke about her past. In the mornings, Thea helped out with minor chores, sweeping and cleaning the tavern before returning to the family forge in the afternoon. Then, as all the guests were settling in for their evening meal, she would take up residence next to the fire and listen to the chatter around her. Thea was fascinated by the patrons that came to the inn, many of them travellers visiting from outside of Solana. She loved to listen to them share stories from their hometown, or describe the things they had seen on their travels. Most travellers came from the villages under Solana\u2019s protection, following one of the many paths leading to the grand city gates. Others, however, came from further afield to visit the great Library of Illumination, or listen to speeches in the Amphitheatre. The busiest time of the year, however, was during the Solstice of Laurels. The Solstice took place once a year, equal parts celebration and ceremony for the Hand of Sol. Great processions of knights clad in ceremonial armour strode through the streets of Solana, gathering at the base of the Amphitheatre. Templars, radiant in gold and ivory, marching with their weapons held high, their masks gleaming in the light of the sun. Trainees, squires, knights, all stepping forward to receive the blessings of the Grand Magister. Where some were commended for completing their training, recognised before all of Solana, others were commended for their excellence and dedication, proudly accepting their promotions. After them, a few blessed individuals stepped forward to be inducted as Templars, receiving their masks with honour. Thea always looked forward to the Solstice. Sitting high above the arena, she would watch as the knights of Solana marched forward in perfect unison, their heads raised high with pride. Visitors came from all over Rathe to witness the ceremony, and see the noble men and women who became the new generation of knights for the Hand of Sol. After the ceremony concluded, she would make her way back to the Golden Chariot to listen to the visitors talking in hushed whispers, their voices full of awe as they spoke of the Solstice, and the radiant warriors who marched beneath the light of the sun. The Awakening While Thea admired the Hand of Sol, she already knew her destiny. Her family had been chosen long ago to serve Solana as master blacksmiths, and she was proud to continue the Ironsong legacy. So, when the day finally came for the Awakening ceremony, on the eve of her eighth birthday, Thea was ready to don the blacksmith\u2019s apron and join her parents in the forge. Following the chancellor into the ceremonial chamber, Thea went to stand at the centre of the room, looking around at all of the objects lining the walls. She searched for the gentle light of a blacksmith\u2019s hammer activating, awakening, glowing like a dying ember in the heat of the forge. Yet, as Thea waited, she did not see a hammer, nor an anvil, tongs, or the blacksmith\u2019s heavy apron. Instead, hundreds of swords all began to shine, resonating with the light of Sol. They darted into the air, flying around her like stars around the sun. Their glow was so bright that they began to illuminate the entire room, the darkened hall flooding with the vibrant light of the noonday sun. One sword in particular caught Thea\u2019s attention, a graceful, thin blade with a gilded hilt. It circled closer and closer, and on its next pass, Thea reached out and plucked it from the air, grasping it tightly in her tiny hand. All at once, the rest of the swords fell to the ground with a sharp clatter, still and silent upon the marble floor.   The next day, the Archon of Thea\u2019s district proclaimed her a prodigy swordsman of great potential, and Thea was immediately enrolled into training with the Hand of Sol. Even as her parents rejoiced, honoured that Sol would choose their daughter to be a knight, Minerva only watched Thea quietly, something unreadable lingering in her shrewd gaze. Genesis Thea\u2019s training began with simple classes, taught by scholars from the Light of Sol. Their lessons covered everything from the history of Solana, to the lands beyond the city walls, to the many creatures of Rathe. As their training progressed, this grew to include theory relevant to their training, such as the structure of different weapons and armour, how to identify their opponents\u2019 weaknesses, and how to play to their own strengths. Thea quickly made friends with two of her fellow trainees. Valeria, short and stubborn, was determined to live up to her family legacy, and spoke of her desire to one day become a templar. Felix was a dark-haired, light-hearted, enthusiastic young boy, excited about their training and filled with gratitude to Sol for giving him the chance to become a knight. The trio were inseparable, spending almost every waking hour in each other\u2019s company.   Every day, Thea rose from her warm bed above the family forge and travelled to the outer walls to begin training. Solides through Verides were spent with scholars and knights in the classroom, learning theory. Exorides and Merides were spent training, beginning with drills to learn footwork and technique, before progressing to sparring as they grew older and a little more experienced. Finally, Vesperides would come - a day of rest, for the trainees to do as they pleased, and enjoy the company of their family and friends. Thea, Valeria and Felix often spent Vesperides either in the Golden Chariot, listening to travellers\u2019 tales, or in the Amphitheatre, listening to the Magisters who spoke the word of Sol. On their way home, strolling amongst the verdant gardens of the Silvarium, they would often talk about the future, dreaming about the day that they would journey outside the walls as knights of Solana. They wondered aloud about distant lands, imagining what they might see beyond the golden fields. The tales they heard in the Golden Chariot fuelled their imaginations, and they dreamed together about the day they would step forward to uphold their sacred duty. Most of all, they dreamt about their future party, and the radiant templar that would lead them beyond the great gates of Solana. Over time, their schedule began to shift, allowing for more time for physical training to perfect their fighting abilities and prepare them for battle. Their lessons covered everything that they might need to survive, information that would be crucial to protecting themselves from the horrors of the outside world. \u201cYou have no need to fear the world beyond the walls,\u201d Charis told them. Their main instructor, she reminded them to put their faith in Sol. \u201cThe glory of Sol will protect you from any threat. Sol knows all and will always guide you to the path of the Light.\u201d Even as Thea revelled in their training, finding joy in the structure and purpose granted by the will of Sol, she struggled with the rigid beliefs of her teachers. Meanwhile, her fellow trainees grew quieter and more reserved with each passing year, settling into their roles within the Hand of Sol. Come Together After six long years, Thea, Valeria and Felix journeyed to the Amphitheatre, excited to meet their party and receive the weapons and armour of a squire. The Solstice of Laurels commenced as a procession of noble warriors marched onto the stage, bowing their heads before the cheering crowds. As the trainees crossed the stage, pausing to receive the Magister\u2019s blessings with a humble bow, Thea turned to look out over the crowds before her, all rejoicing under the light of the sun. The Solstice continued long into the day, the figures of proud lieutenants stepping aside to give room to the templars, resplendent in their gilded ceremonial armour. Thea and Valeria, assigned to the same party, stepped forward to meet the templar striding toward them. A masked figure cast in gold and silver met their gaze, armour polished to a bright shine, the features of her mask pulled into an aloof expression, with eyes that made it seem as if she were staring straight through them.   The templar, Hala, introduced them to their lieutenant, a younger man named Farris; the knights of their party, Vitus, Pallas and Darius; and Marcus, a scholar from the Light of Sol. The party left Solana the following day, and ventured out into the villages, patrolling and offering help to those in need. Repairing damaged buildings, tracking down lost livestock, bolstering defenses, digging wells, building fences, hunting wild beasts, tracking and exterminating groups of bandits; anything that the villagers needed. Marcus, as a senior scholar, helped to heal the sick and injured, and gave speeches about Sol and the blessings of the Light. They roamed the plains beyond Solana, staying in villages for weeks, sometimes months at a time. By day, they worked tirelessly to help their neighbours, and by night, sat by the local inn\u2019s fire to hear stories from grateful villagers. On their travels, the party often told stories to pass the time, sharing their own experiences or stories from Solana\u2019s history. Thea\u2019s memories of her time as a squire were often fond recollections of these moments, spent laughing and chatting under the light of the sun. She often went forward to join Hala at the front of the party, finding moments to talk to the radiant templar. Hala indulged the young squire, sharing tales of her past and lessons she\u2019d learned while in the Hand of Sol. Occasionally, Thea would manage to convince Hala to spar with her, taking advantage of the tiny breaks between their patrols. Wielding Dawnblade, the sword that she had been bestowed during her Awakening ceremony, Thea was quick and agile, darting around her opponent with ease. However, the templar was a relentless opponent, constantly one step ahead. In all their time together, Thea only managed to get past Hala\u2019s shield three times, basking in the quiet pride in the Hala\u2019s voice as she congratulated her. Several months into their patrol, one villager spoke to them in whispers, describing a massacre that had been discovered within the jungles to the west. They described a party of knights that lay strewn across the earth, armour torn open, blood coating the ground in a layer of muddied crimson. The tale was not unusual, in and of itself - the Savage Lands were known for their dangers, and occasionally, a party was caught off guard by the beasts that lurk within. However, rumours began to spread of horrific beasts emerging from the jungles, charging along the outermost reaches of the Savage Lands in a mindless frenzy. As reports poured in of attacks on outlying villages, the party spent more and more time in the villages on the outskirts of the golden fields, patrolling the area in an attempt to lessen the attacks. They found villages ransacked, bodies lying in the fields, dusty roads littered with blood and entrails. From packs of smaller beasts, to massive creatures with armoured hides, the beasts of the Savage Lands were travelling further than ever before; frenzied, relentless, they fought with reckless abandon, tearing a path through the village until they were finally struck down. Sometimes the party arrived in time to fend off the creatures and save innocent lives. At other times, they arrived to find an empty village, as if its townspeople had vanished in the middle of the night. The only signs of conflict came from the occasional bloodstain, smeared along the side of a building, a streak of crimson left amongst the grassy fields. Five years after the party had left Solana, Marcus woke the party before dawn. In the morning twilight, he relayed a message sent by an archon, summoning them to one of the forward camps located on the outskirts of the Savage Lands. They travelled for almost two weeks before they finally arrived at the forward camp, finding a clearing filled with silver and gold. Knights, lieutenants and templars were packed into the camp, almost completely drowning out the merchant\u2019s stalls lining the border of the clearing. The templars\u2019 masks gleamed in the pale sunlight as they conversed with scholars, gathered near the centre of the clearing. Hala disappeared into the crowd to find the archon who had summoned them, Marcus close behind. Behind them, the rest of the party lingered at the edge of the clearing, watching as the sea of knights parted before Hala\u2019s determined stride. Into the Wilderness Along the outskirts of the Savage Lands, forward camps lie hidden between the trees, constructed long ago by the Hand of Sol. They serve as entry points to the jungle beyond, and as a safe space for knights and adventurers alike to rest and restock supplies. The camps usually accommodated for one or two parties at a time, and were mostly occupied by merchants, traders, adventurers, and the occasional band of mercenaries. Now, however, the forward camps were overflowing with warriors from Solana, bedrolls lining the clearing. Any party near the Savage Lands had been summoned. Templars and scholars stepped aside to gather in meetings, planning patrols and keeping the camps running as they discussed the growing threat from the Savage Lands. For weeks, they remained within the jungle, awaiting news from the Grand Council. Then, finally, the scholars received their orders. Templars, scholars and veteran knights were to group together and search the jungle for information. While the senior members banded together, the lieutenants gathered the remaining knights and squires into parties to patrol the borders, and maintain a line of defense between the savage wilds and the golden fields. Farris took control of their party, leading them on minor scouting missions along the outskirts of the jungle. For months, they patrolled the borders of the jungle, hunting down any creature that emerged from the depths of the Savage Lands. Hala and the rest of her squadron were gone for days at a time, travelling deep into the jungle in increasingly longer journeys. In her moments of rest between missions, Hala would rejoin the party to check in on her charges and pass on any updates. Between all of the travel, meetings and planning, Hala would occasionally find a spare moment to spar with Thea between the trees, a tiny respite from the quiet frenzy of the forward camps. The Road of Trials One day, Thea\u2019s party was returning from patrol when they caught a glimpse of smoke between the trees. When the camp finally came into view, the sight was bloodcurdling. Scraps of torn fabric were strewn across the camp, littering the dirt with white, red and gold; one of the tents was on fire, billowing black smoke, while another hung limply from the branches of a nearby tree; blood was smeared into the dirt, a dark crimson stain against the dusty earth; a single corpse lay out in the open, head torn from its shoulders. The merchants, mercenaries and warriors that had been in the clearing hours prior were nowhere to be found, only a single fragment of dented metal left behind to mark their presence. After several minutes of silence, Farris relayed their orders from a nearby scholar - secure the camp, guard the remaining supplies, and wait for the parties to return. Thea tried to convince Farris to go after the missing people, that they could be out there somewhere, still alive, dying in slow, silent agony as they waited for someone to come for them. However, it didn\u2019t work. Quietly, gently, Farris repeated their orders, reminding her that Sol knew best. Thea was certain that there had to be a mistake. She had seen first-hand the brutality and savagery that the creatures of the Savage Lands were capable of. Surely Sol, a being of wisdom and mercy, wouldn\u2019t tell them to leave innocent people to their fate, torn apart by vicious beasts, disembowelled and left to slowly bleed to death. For a while, Thea continued to help her party clean up the camp and secure what was left, but by sundown, she had made up her mind. As the sun began to set and those present were working to secure the camp, Thea took her chance. She stole several weapons from the stockpile and disappeared into the shadows. At first, she struggled to find any tracks, but eventually stumbled across some blood smeared against a tree trunk. Thea followed the tracks for several hours, stopping every so often to gather her bearings and find the next part of the trail. Then, at last, Thea found her missing people.   Four brutes lay within the clearing, while a fifth sat watch near the captives, its head bowed in sleep. Eleven people were tied to the trees next to it. Thea recognised six of them as merchants, and two more bore the armour of the Hand of Sol. The remaining three appeared to be mercenaries, judging by their light armour. Slowly, quietly, she made her way over to the two knights, untying them and handing them a weapon each. While she worked on the mercenaries, she looked over, expecting the two knights to already be on their feet and helping others - yet they were still sitting against the tree. On closer inspection, Thea saw the wounds seeping crimson against their armour, the way they were slumped forward, faces waxy and pale. They were barely going to be able to walk, let alone wield a weapon. The rest of the group were little better. Many of the captives appeared to be badly wounded, exhausted, or suffering from extreme blood loss. Just as she began to wonder how she was going to help these people escape, she heard the distinctive rasp of metal against wood. Behind her, the guard rose to its feet, club clenched tightly in one fist. Thea drew her blade, already moving in an attempt to silence it before it could alert the rest of the pack, but it was too late - with a bellowing roar, it roused the other brutes from their slumber. As the pack lurched to their feet, Thea noticed one of the warriors out of the corner of her eye, struggling to rise, leaning heavily on the tree as he straightened. Raising Dawnblade before her, Thea placed herself between the pack of brutes and the camp survivors. She was preparing herself for battle when she noticed a faint flash of light between the trees, recognising the metallic shine of silver armour. Hala and the rest of her party burst into the clearing, the templar holding her shield out before her as she charged the brutes, brandishing her sword, shining with the light of Marcus\u2019s magic. Within seconds, the group was under attack, and the sounds of fierce battle filled the clearing. The party began to make some headway as one of the brutes ran into the jungle, badly injured. For a moment, it almost seemed as if they could all make it out okay. Yet before they could defeat the remaining brutes, before they could help any of the captives to their feet, before they could even try to get anybody back to camp, a great bellow echoed throughout the clearing. Nine more brutes emerged from the line of trees, one of them towering high above the others, skin grey and craggy, eyes dark as it charged toward them. They were outnumbered, overpowered, and outmatched. The party had no choice but to flee. As Hala sounded a retreat, charging at the brutes to give the rest of the party enough time to flee, Thea started forward to help the captives struggling to their feet. Then Marcus appeared before her. Blocking her path, he pulled her away, dragging her out of the clearing and forcing her to run toward the camp. As they dashed through the trees, the air was filled with the sound of pained screams, echoing from all those they had left behind. When the morning came, the sun rising to flood the forward camp with light, only three members of the party had emerged into the campsite. Marcus and Thea arrived first, supporting Hala between them, grey-faced from blood loss, her head hanging limply from her shoulders. While, with some difficulty, Thea had been forced to leave the others behind, she had refused to return to camp without Hala. The pair found her on the brink of death, badly injured from her battle with the brutes. Even as the scholars rushed to lie her down on a bedroll, calling light to their fingertips, her breathing grew shallower, her wounds still seeping blood. Several hours later, just as Thea was about to give up hope, another group of knights entered the clearing, one of them carrying an unconscious Valeria over one shoulder. For hours, the camp was bustling with activity as other parties returned from scouting missions and damage control. Thea watched silently, oblivious to the commotion around her as she observed her friend. As Valeria finally began to stir, Thea felt a flood of relief wash over her, rising from her bedroll to make her way over to her friend. Yet when Valeria glanced in her direction, her expression shuttered, and Thea watched as she turned her face away, a burning anger in her eyes. Return to the Fold In the years since leaving Solana, Thea had imagined their return to the city more than once: the party marching through the gates, welcomed by their people, pleased to return to their home. Yet at the age of nineteen, Thea found the reality to be much different. Their quiet procession through the fates was sombre, the walls pale in the light of dawn as they passed through the city streets. Valeria marched ahead of her, carrying Vitus\u2019 shield on one arm, completely silent. Hala sat atop a dark mare, her face still pale, clutching her side with one arm as Thea slowly led her horse forward. Thea could feel Marcus\u2019s gaze upon her back, and she wondered idly if Sol was watching her as well, looking on in disapproval. After handing in her armour, Thea made her way back to the smithing district. As she walked down the main street, gaze fixed on the outline of Minerva\u2019s tavern, she began to slow, coming to a halt in front of her childhood home. Through the open doors, she could see the forge burning brightly, smoke wafting out into the gentle breeze as her parents rushed toward her with open arms. She spent several hours with her parents, answering all of their questions with a growing sense of exhaustion. Finally, she found an opportunity to slip away to the Golden Chariot. The moment that she stepped through the front door; Thea came face to face with the tavern owner\u2019s steely gaze. For a moment, both stood completely still, staring silently at one another. Streaks of grey had appeared in Minerva\u2019s vibrant auburn hair, dark circles hanging beneath her eyes, fine wrinkles lining her skin. She looked so much older than Thea remembered, and yet somehow, it seemed as if she hadn\u2019t changed at all. Just as she opened her mouth to say something, Minerva suddenly lurched forward, wrapping Thea in a tight hug. In the familiar comfort of the inn, Minerva listened silently as Thea described the last few years. She spoke of the rumours that had spread, of the fear and unease, of the village that they\u2019d found in ruins. She spoke of travelling to the Savage Lands and patrolling the outskirts of the jungle. She spoke of coming back to find the forward camp in chaos, of the captives that had been taken and the people still missing. She spoke of leaving to find survivors, of stumbling across the pack of brutes, and trying to help them, and how it had achieved nothing. That four of her party members had died trying to make up for her mistake. That they hadn\u2019t even managed to save any of the captives in the end. When Thea was finished, Minerva smiled sadly. \u201cI know that you were only trying to do the right thing. That\u2019s what matters, Thea.\u201d Yet even as Minerva comforted her, Thea felt the burden of her mistakes weighing on her shoulders, unable to forget the deaths that she had caused. Redemption For months, she waited, helping to serve customers in the tavern, working in the forge, and travelling to the outer walls for sparring sessions. The Solstice came and passed, and while her fellow squires were inducted into the Hand of Sol as full knights, Thea remained on the outskirts of the ceremony with the other Solanians. For a time, it almost seemed as if she would never don her armour again, and she wondered what happened to those who failed to fulfil their chosen role. And then, she received a summons from Hala.   The templar stood tall, radiant in the centre of the antechamber. Her shining armour hid any possible signs of what had happened, and Thea struggled to tell if Hala was fully healed, or if she had suffered any lasting injuries or scars. Thea struggled to meet her gaze; head bowed as she murmured her greetings. For several moments, silence filled the room, until finally she looked up. Hala\u2019s impassive mask stared back at her, even as she gently placed a hand on Thea\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAre you ready to prove yourself?\u201d Rite of Passage Once a year, the kingdom of Solana holds the Solstice of Laurels, a celebration of the Hand of Sol. Templars, resplendent in their ceremonial armour, lead great processions of knights through the city streets, gathering at the base of the Amphitheatre. Then, at noon, the ceremony would finally begin. Squires completing their training step forward to stand before the Grand Magister, heads bowed as they proudly receive the blessings of Sol. Thea slowly stepped forward, bowing deeply before the radiant figure of the Grand Magister. Despite the prestige of her accomplishment, promoted to lieutenant at just twenty-one years old, Thea remains strangely solemn. She cannot forget the events that have led to this moment, or the people that she has lost along the way. With her mistakes weighing heavily upon her shoulders, Thea is determined to do better, and become an exemplary lieutenant worthy of her position. Before the people of Solana, Thea makes a promise to herself - she will learn from her past, follow the will of Sol, and honour her people. \u201cIn the name of Sol, I swear that I shall serve Solana to the best of my ability, until death relieves me of this sacred duty. I swear that I will protect Solana, and all those who live within its walls.\u201d Her voice rang out, cutting through the hushed quiet of the crowds watching over her. \u201cBy the blessed light, I shall carry out this oath, and never shall I knowingly nor willingly violate this, my solemn oath and obligation as a lieutenant of Solana, the outstretched hand of Sol. By the glory of Sol\u2019s light, in Sol\u2019s name, so shall it be.\u201d",

        "The combined nervous chatter of fourty young wizards was almost deafening, bouncing off the walls in a way that made his ears ring. Ryo looked around the room, gazing at the tense expressions of the other students gathered nearby. One of the youngest in the room looked as if she was going to pass out, her face pale with anxiety, small hands trembling as she teased a flame into existence between her fingers.   Ryo ran a hand over his already immaculate robes, straightening the fabric with a small frown. Despite his age, he was already wearing the apophis hairpin that marked him as the Hideshi heir, its obsidian scales gleaming in the firelight. Noting the curious stare of a couple of older students, Ryo dipped his head in greeting, watching as their gaze landed on the hairpin. One of them turned slightly to whisper in the other\u2019s ear, hiding the movement of his lips behind one hand. Finally, the Lord Wizard Akihiko strode into the room, instantly gathering everyone\u2019s attention. The crimson fabric pooled around his feet as he came to a halt, raising one hand. \u201cI need each of you to find a brazier and stand next to it.\u201d He paused, blinking slowly. \u201cNow, if you please.\u201d The students burst into a flurry of movement as each one rushed to find a brazier. Ryo stepped behind the nearest brazier, looking down at the golden glow seeping out onto the polished stone tiles. \u201cI believe most of you will have already heard about the Trial of Embers before, but for those of you who haven\u2019t, I will start from the beginning.\u201d Clearing his throat, the Lord Wizard Akihiko gestured to the nearest brazier. \u201cThe rules are simple. What you see before you is lava harvested from the crater of Mt. Volcor. \u201cYour task is to draw it from the brazier. This may seem simple, but lava is much harder to manipulate than fire or aether. This trial is designed to determine your innate abilities, and your potential as the future wizards of Volcor. The most successful among you may be chosen by one of the Lord Wizards as a deshi, and assume the responsibilities of\u2026\u201d Ryo noted several of the students beginning to zone out, their eyes glazing over as they stared off into the distance. If their overseer took any notice, he didn\u2019t show it. The Lord Wizard\u2019s footsteps echoed through the room, the click-clack of his shoes against the stone tiles rebounding off the walls. Ryo\u2019s gaze followed the Lord Wizard as he paced down the line of students, staring ahead with his chin held high. \u201c...of course, there are still rules that must be obeyed. This is a test of aptitude and natural ability, and so the use of any arcane item is prohibited. Each of you has descended from the first Emperor of Volcor, gifted with the blood of the Dracai. As members of the royal bloodline, you are blessed with an affinity for fire aether\u2026\u201d The student next to Ryo had his head bowed, staring intently at something in the palm of his hand. His long, jet-black hair was pulled up into a high ponytail, only decorated with a single vuurlin feather. The other boy wore his dark grey robes with pride, his dark eyes gleaming with a keen intelligence, expression alight with mischief. He looked slightly older than Ryo, perhaps fifteen, at most. Ryo startled at the feeling of something hitting his ankle, glancing over to the student to find him grinning, balancing his weight on one foot as he prepared to kick again. Ryo pointedly ignored him, lips thinning as he continued to stare at the Lord Wizard Akihiko. \u201c...more than welcome to observe others, or otherwise prepare for your trial, but do not converse with other students. This is a test of natural ability, and giving another student advice or information is strictly prohibited. Of course\u2026\u201d Just as Ryo thought the other boy had given up, he felt a hand slide into his pocket .The boy withdrew, quietly leaning back into his usual spot. After a moment, Ryo reached into his pocket with one hand, withdrawing a small slip of parchment. Slowly, he turned to look over his shoulder, glancing at the other student.   \u201cRead it.\u201d The whisper was just barely audible, but even watching the boy\u2019s face, Ryo wasn\u2019t sure he hadn\u2019t seen his lips move. Ryo lifted one eyebrow before looking down at the note in his hand, fingers cupped to hide it from view. He could see the script faintly shimmering on its surface, just barely visible in the light. Turning silently, he glared at the other boy, gesturing silently to the note. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d Ryo hissed under his breath, gaze flicking to the Lord Wizard, watching him heading back toward them. \u201cAn incantation.\u201d The boy shrugged. \u201cA few of us have got \u2018em. It\u2019ll help with your magic.\u201d \u201c...now,\u201d the Lord Wizard Akihiko suddenly boomed, his voice rising as he came to a halt in the dead centre of the room. \u201cYour trial begins. Show me what you can do.\u201d Ryo glanced back at the other boy, who was watching him with one eyebrow raised. \u201cThe Lord Wizard said-\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just a simple incantation. It\u2019s not that different to the ones we\u2019ve covered before.\u201d Ryo looked over the symbols with a small frown, recognising only a few of the words. \u201cAll the wizards use it for this trial. It helps with concentration.\u201d They both paused at the sound of a distressed cry, turning to look at one of the wizards across the hall. The same girl that Ryo had noticed earlier was standing over her brazier, tears in her eyes, as the molten lava melted the remains of the metal, pouring out onto the stone tiles. The Lord Wizard, standing nearby, shook his head as he moved onto the next student. \u201cYou only get one shot. You really want to end up like her?\u201d The boy looked back at Ryo with a shrug. \u201cYour choice, I guess.\u201d As the other student turned back to his own brazier, Ryo frowned, looking down at the note in his hand. With a small sigh, he nodded to himself. Straightening, he stretched his free hand towards the brazier, palm facing the lava pooled within. Ryo muttered the incantation under his breath, and with a gesture, began to draw the lava up into the air. The lava answered sluggishly, pushing back against Ryo\u2019s control. He could feel its resistance, as if he were trying to force it through a wall of solid stone, and even with all of his concentration, he could barely command it to move. It rose painfully slowly, almost solid as it moved up through the air, obstinate despite Ryo\u2019s best efforts. A vein twitched in his forehead, his face flushing with the sheer effort of commanding the lava to move. As a bright flare lit the opposite end of the hall, his tentative focus shattered, and his control over the lava snapped. It fell back into the brazier with a strange, hollow sound, not unlike the strike of metal on metal. What splashed over the sides quickly cooled against the stone tiles, solidifying before Ryo could think to remove it. The Lord Wizard Akihiko was silent as he passed, gaze fixed on the pool of lava splashed across the stone tiles. With a gesture, he allowed the remainder to extinguish, and Ryo watched silently as the brazier\u2019s contents cooled to a dull grey. Ryo glanced around the hall to find several others in the same position as himself, their heads bowed. Some had braziers that appeared to be one solid mass of rapidly cooling rock, others had accidentally reduced theirs to a puddle of molten metal and lava. The Lord Wizard Akihiko looked between them all with a dark expression, silently stalking past those among them who had failed. Just as he opened his mouth in preparation to speak, a bright flare of light caught everyone\u2019s attention The boy to Ryo\u2019s left, the same one that had passed him the note, was weaving his lava through the air with a bright grin, his face alight with a crimson glow. Its movements were almost serpentine as it danced around him, glowing brighter with every second. The molten rock became thinner and thinner as the lava superheated, transforming into a vibrant golden orange. The lava curled outward, cooling into a mass of scales, whiskers sprouting from the head of the serpentine form. A pair of horns formed from the top of its head, a mouth seperating to reveal a series of sharp teeth, the tongue lolling out as it opened its mouth and roared. With a burst of flame, the lava took the shape of a dragon, burning brighter with each passing second. The dragon circled him in one massive loop, weaving through the air, illuminating the wizard\u2019s triumphant grin. With a gesture, he sent the dragon flying toward the ceiling, brushing just shy of the rafters before diving back down into the brazier, releasing a shower of molten rock. They paused just before they hit the floor, reversing their trajectory to land back inside the brazier, and the mass of lava coalesced back into one molten pool once more. Ryo heard several of the other students gasp behind him, and turned slightly to see the Lord Wizard drawing closer, something unreadable barely visible within his carefully blank expression.   \u201cWell done, Kano. Good work.\u201d After a long moment, the Lord Wizard finally gave Kano a simple nod before turning back to the other students, continuing on to inspect those remaining. Over the glow of his brazier, Kano grinned, winking at Ryo. \u201cWhat was the incantation you gave me?\u201d He asked, watching the other wizard with a small frown. \u201cI found it in a tome in the palace library..\u201d \u201c...You didn\u2019t know what was going to happen?\u201d \u201cIt worked when I used it. I don\u2019t know what went wrong when you tried.\u201d Kano met his gaze with a blink, shrugging. \u201cHey, it could have helped. I didn\u2019t know it would backfire. Anyway, you\u2019re not the only one.\u201d Ryo turned slightly to look at some of the other students who had failed, staring at the state of their braziers. \u201cYou do realise that the Lord Wizard will find out, right? Everybody\u2019s going to know you cheated.\u201d Kano shrugged. \u201cWorth it.\u201d As the other students began to filter out of the room, Kano followed suit, giving Ryo a little wave as he left through the main door. The few of them that had used Kano\u2019s incantation were kept behind, subjected to a long lecture from the Lord Wizard and questioned about the results of their trial. Mysteriously, all of them realised that Kano\u2019s notes had disintegrated into fine, powdery ash, erasing the only evidence of the incantation. Deep within the royal palace, the seventy-eight members of the Chamber of the Dragon were gathered in the great hall. The gold leaf panel at the back of the room almost seemed to shimmer in the lantern light, disguising a passage leading to the innermost section of the palace. \u201cThe Trial of Embers took place this morning. Of the twenty-eight students that were tested, nineteen successfully completed the trial.\u201d The Lord Wizard Akihiko hesitated, clearing his throat. \u201cOne of these students displayed the aptitude of Caldera.\u201d A low murmur rippled through the room as the Chancellor frowned, dipping his chin to stare at Akihiko. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible for a wizard of his age.\u201d \u201cWe couldn\u2019t find any runestones or charged crystals, the brazier was unmarked, and we did not find evidence of a sigil. I cast the aetheric ward myself, and its efficacy was tested by three senior wizards. The boy should not have been able to cast or draw aether.\u201d The Lord Chancellor frowned, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. \u201cInteresting. Keep a close eye on him, Lord Wizard Akihiko. If he truly did use an aetheric spell, in spite of your wards, this student of yours may prove useful.\u201d",

        "(Story illus. by Nikolay Moskvin. Ft. art of Bramasta Aji.) The blade whistled faintly as it soared past her cheekbone, her head ducked as she sidestepped the raiders attack. With a sharp exhale, she swept past his follow-up attack, sword glancing off her crossed blades with a loud clang. Kassai scowled as she sprung backwards, narrowly avoiding a third slash. Out of the corner of her eye, she noted her fellow Cintari, scattered throughout the ruined village. Her feet dragged in the ashen sand, eight inches of fine powder clinging to her every move. With a flick of her wrist, Kassai deflected a second raider\u2019s attack, his dagger sailing as it flew into the remains of a nearby building. A split-second glance showed the dagger embedded in a half-collapsed wall, a fingers-breadth from the pale face of one terrified ex-villager. Clicking her tongue, Kassai swept one leg out from underneath her first opponent, pressing the advantage before he could regain his footing.   All around her, shouts and the clang of metal on metal filled the air, the unmistakable clamour of battle echoing through the ruined buildings. The villagers they\u2019d accompanied cowered behind broken walls and torched furniture, watching with wide eyes as the Cintari got down to business. Looking around her for the raider\u2019s leader, she caught a glimpse of him amidst the chaos, a wide grin splitting his face from ear to ear as he cut down one of her men. With a hissed curse, she whistled sharply between her teeth, attempting to gather the group around her. Suddenly, a flash of lightning flared above them, lighting the entire southern sky a bright, brilliant shade of violet. It hung in the air for several seconds, illuminating a wall of dust flying toward them. The thunderclap hit them with the force of an earthquake, rumbling through the earth at their feet. Kassai felt her teeth chatter, all sound muting for a heartbeat until her ears released a loud pop. As the violet light faded from the skies above, an inky darkness crept across the icy blue, flowing directly in front of the sun. The shadow spread rapidly, blocking out the light and casting the world around them into crimson shade.   A sharp cry reached her ears as one of the villagers collapsed to his knees, pressing his forehead against the earth. He curled his hands in the air before him, stretched out toward the faint silhouette of Mt. Volcor. \u201cThe dragon! It awakens!\u201d \u201cGreat dragon!\u201d \u201cThe dragon has returned!\u201d All at once, the villagers around her fell to the ground, trembling, wide eyes bright within their pale faces. \u201cShe has returned to us!\u201d \u201cThe dragon!\u201d The raiders froze, a darkness crossing their expressions as they glanced at one another uncertainly, hesitating for one long second. Darting forward, Kassai raised her twin swords above her head, slashing the man before her from shoulder to hip. With a wet gurgle, he collapsed, blood spilling onto the ashen sands. Blades flashed in the darkness as the Cintari leapt into action, striking down the raiders without hesitation. As his brothers-in-arms fell, one man attempted to make a run for it, throwing himself into the path of Kassai\u2019s blade. With a gesture, she summoned the man toward her, encircling the last few raiders. Once the last raider had dropped to the ground, Kassai marched over to the group\u2019s leader, immediately identifiable by his armour. Loosening the straps of his chestplate, she pried it free, turning it over in her hands. Despite his haphazard attempt at erasing the mark, the charred general\u2019s signet was still immediately recognisable. With a wide grin, Kassai removed her knife from its pouch, prying the signet free. \u201cOi.\u201d Taka stood on the edge of her peripheral vision, face impassive as he gazed down at her. \u201cFind what you were looking for?\u201d Rising to her feet, Kassai tucked the signet into one of her pouches, shaking the sand from her hair. \u201cYeah, we\u2019re good. You?\u201d In answer, he raised a bulky sack of goods, nodding to the villagers behind him. \u201cDon\u2019t even care, too busy staring at the sky to worry \u2018bout us.\u201d Kassai turned her face toward the sun\u2019s silhouette, drawing her hood up with one hand as she stared into the distance. The warm light of the morning sun cast the city streets in gold, illuminating the embroidered banners hanging above. A figure strolled down the ivory pavement, her hair a flaxen gold, silversteel armour gleaming, polished to a brilliant shine. The crimson cloak fluttered in the light breeze, the symbol of Solana embossed onto her chestplate. Exchanging a bright smile with one of the merchants, the lieutenant bowed her head in greeting, gaze sweeping across the crowds.   As she passed beneath one of the stone archways of the plaza, Dorinthea glanced at the crowd around her, listening to the hum of the nearby marketplace. Buildings lined the path ahead of her, the ivory spires of the Solarium stretching above the rooftops. Like a shadow passing in front of the sun, cold seeped down her spine, a sudden feeling of dread making her skin prickle with gooseflesh. Frozen, Thea wrapped her fingers around the hilt of her sword, standing perfectly still amongst the bustling crowds. From one second to the next, the city abruptly fell quiet, the day\u2019s vibrant buzz plunging into the dead silence of night. A blinding pain hit her with the force of a lighting bolt, driving her to her knees. Thea clutched her skull with both hands, grimacing, vision marred by black spots as she struggled against the pain reverberating inside her head. Distantly, she thought she heard a scream, echoing around her as if she were at the other end of a very long tunnel. After a seemingly endless stretch of time, the pain finally began to ease. Forcing her eyes open, Thea squinted, trying to take in the scene around her. The crowd had parted before her, allowing her to glimpse a scholar kneeling on the other side of the courtyard, his face white as sun-bleached bone. Exhaling sharply through gritted teeth, Thea turned her gaze to the ground between them, noting the dust trembling atop the paved stone. Abruptly, the unsettling quiet shattered, voices all around her crying out in alarm. Shade seeped across the courtyard, and when Thea looked up, she realised why. Above them, a darkness blotted out the sun, leaving the world around them blanketed in shadow. Dark stormclouds began to form in the sky, seemingly materialising from thin air. In the distance, the silhouette of Solana\u2019s southwest gate shuddered, and as everyone turned as one to look in its direction, it toppled with an audible groan. Even at a distance, Thea could feel the tremble in the ground as it collapsed inward, exposing shadowed figures standing just beyond the city walls. A deafening screech filled the courtyard as something streaked through the air, and a nearby building exploded in a cloud of dust, showering the crowds with chunks of rubble and ash. A massive, twisted creature clambered out of the ruins, releasing another hair-raising shriek as it staggered to its feet, turning dozens of dark, lightless eyes onto the people gathered in the city streets. The window of the tower above shattered, the glass bursting outward in a shower of broken glass. From the emptied frame, a creature slowly emerged into the dim light, its towering form eerily pale, translucent skin torn open by networks of ink-black veins. With an ear-splitting screech, it began to climb through, joining its brethren on the street below. The ice-cold sensation of dread gave way to a flood of panic, setting her veins alight. Her heart grew heavy within her chest, blood pounding in her ears as Thea drew her blade, forcing herself to her feet. She almost choked on the wave of nausea that swept over her, pausing for a split-second as she struggled to draw breath into her lungs. Looking up, she caught the scholar\u2019s eye, watching as he conjured a shimmering veil of light over the crowd. \u2018Beloved people of Solana.\u2019 The voice echoed deep within her chest, a rumble of thunder on the horizon. It took Thea a long moment to recognise the voice for what it was, coming to an abrupt halt. All around her, people froze, awe dawning on their faces in spite of the chaos that surrounded them. \u2018Do not cower in fear. Look to the Light of Sol. Gather in the plazas, and listen to your chancellors. They shall guide you now, as always.\u2019 Dorinthea stood guard as the crowds began to move, following the decree of the Grand Magister. As if changing in volume, the voice dimmed, this time the quiet brush of a whisper.   \u2018Come to the Solarium, noble knights, and ready your blades\u2026 the Shadow has emerged once more.\u2019",

        "Amidst the clamor of the marketplace, a woman pushed her way through the crowds, clutching a parcel to her chest. Her long brown hair was drawn back into a neat braid, several copper cogs flashing in the light as she ducked under a metalworker\u2019s load. In one hand, she held an instructional booklet, glancing down at it with a frown. Her expression seemed troubled as she stared down at one of the diagrams, turning the page with her thumb. \u201cDevices! Trinkets! One\u2019uva kind inventions! Get ya steamtech here!\u201d   As the flow of the crowd shoved her out to the sides of the thoroughfare, she stumbled into a merchant\u2019s stall, drawing his attention. He reached out with one plump, gloved hand to steady her. Behind a single table adorned with a crudely painted sign, the merchant peered out from beneath his bushy eyebrows, curled lips revealing a toothy grin. His entire head was covered by a mass of messy white hair and a giant hat, his figure obscured by layers upon layers of cloth, leather and fur. \u201cY\u2019 alright, lady? Look like yer having some trouble. Maybe one of these devices is just whatcha need\u2026\u201d The woman looked down at the array of devices scattered across the table, each one formed from mismatched metal, some with the remnants of labels or other logos still half-etched into the surface. \u201cOh, uh- I\u2019m fine, thanks. I don\u2019t need anything.\u201d \u201cYer a research assistant, right?\u201d He smiled, winking when the woman stared at him in surprise. \u201cI know\u2019un when I see one. What\u2019cha got there?\u201d \u201cA focal plane, actually.\u201d \u201cOh? Fer a laser device?\u201d When the woman nodded, he merely sighed in response, scratching at the thick edges of his long, shaggy beard. \u201cThey don\u2019t make those like they used to. I wish ye luck, lass. Sounds like you\u2019ll need it.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d She tilted her head, squinting. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cOh, the lasers these days aren\u2019t nearly as powerful as they used to be. Nobody makes \u2018em like that anymore. When I was a lad, you could carve furniture with a laser; now ye\u2019d be lucky to cut a Centennial loaf. \u2018Course, there\u2019s always the induction chamber.\u201d   \u201cWhat\u2019s an induction chamber?\u201d The research assistant frowned, clutching the package tightly. \u201cWhy would that help?\u201d \u201cWell, you see, it can give any device an extra boost of steam energy. No matter how new or old your steam laser is, an induction chamber\u2019ll fix it right up. Have it runnin\u2019 like the Gigadrill Elevator at sunrise.\u201d He held up a large cylinder emphatically, clearing his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s simply the best investment for a discerning researcher such as yourself. I\u2019ll even lower the price! Just for you, this here device is a mere fifteen credits. It\u2019s handmade, one of a kind, invented by yours truly. You won\u2019t find a better deal at the markets than this!\u201d \u201cYou made it?\u201d She looked the merchant up and down, frowning. \u201cDesigned it from scratch and built it myself. There\u2019s nothing else like it! I\u2019ll even install it directly into the focal plane.\u201d The woman looked back and forth between the induction chamber and the focal plane, biting her lip. \u201cWell, I only have six credits\u2026\u201d \u201cDeal!\u201d The merchant nodded, extending a hand across the table. When she placed the focal plane into his palm, he twirled it, raising it to the sky to peer through the lens. It spun back and forth between his hands as he produced a driver, seemingly out of nowhere, undoing the bolts and tossing them to one side. The woman watched him closely as he worked on the device, eyes darting from side to side as she struggled to keep up with his flashy motions. One second, the induction chamber was sitting on the corner of the table, and the next it was in his hand. She caught a flash of copper as it disappeared into the unit, somehow managing to fit despite the difference in size and shape. With a flourish, he reconnected all of the bolts, revealing the completed unit. \u201cHere you are! Six credits.\u201d She peered down at the unit in his hands, eyebrows furrowed. \u201cBut it looks exactly the same.\u201d \u201cSix credits.\u201d \u201cHow\u2019d you even fit-\u201d \u201cSix credits.\u201d As the credits ticked over into his account, the woman looked up at him, eyes narrowed. \u201cHey, if this doesn\u2019t work, I will come back for my credits.\u201d The merchant shrugged, tucking the device into her arms. \u201cTake care!\u201d He watched quietly as she immediately turned and disappeared into the crowds, giving a little wave.   In the light of midday, the plumes of white around the city were cast a pale gold, parted by the bright blue glow of the Gigadrill Elevator in the distance. As shadows crept across the concrete, the merchant remained at his stall, hands cupped around his mouth as he shouted his wares to passersby. Yet, as the afternoon dragged on, he slowly began to sag, shoulders hunched and back curved. Every would-be customer kept walking straight past the man, despite his best efforts to catch their attention. \u201cUgh. Okay, I\u2019m out,\u201d the merchant groaned, reaching into one sleeve to retrieve a small key. \u201cTime to check up on that researcher from earlier.\u201d He ducked behind his stall, unlocking a false panel in the back of the stand.   Glancing from side to side, he pulled off his wig, revealing a head of bright copper hair. Removing several layers of clothing, the gleam of burnished metal flashed in the sun as the merchant stashed the disguise beneath the market stall. A petite, spry young girl stepped out of her platform shoes, a shower of freckles scattered across her face. \u201cNow,\u201d Dash chirped, producing a tracking device with a grin, \u201clet\u2019s see where you got to.\u201d Slipping out from behind her stall, Dash squeezed past a group of street kids attempting to avoid the attention of an enforcer. She began to make her way through the crowds, gaze flicking back to the display unit attached to her wrist. Leaving the commotion of the markets behind, she traipsed through the Midtown Markets toward the West Rise, travelling further and further into the maze of laboratories. \u201cNot RND, then,\u201d she murmured as she passed beneath the shadow of Centennial Consumables\u2019 head office. \u201cAnd you\u2019re too far from the center of the Rise to be at Cogwerx HQ. Weird.\u201d Dash stalked past the cluster of Cogwerx Conglomerate buildings as she continued onward, tapping intermittently at her tracker. \u201cUgh, come on.\u201d Slowly, a great ivory tower came into view, stretching toward the sky. The Teklo Industries center of operations gleamed in the light of day, a shining beacon amongst the sea of darkened copper. \u201cThe Needle?\u201d After a moment, Dash groaned loudly, hissing through her teeth. \u201cShit, not again. I hope they haven\u2019t started already.\u201d She broke into a run, pushing her way past a group of couriers. Dash ran up to the entrance, banging on the door. Inside, the receptionist turned to glare at her, pausing when she saw her face. After a moment, she picked up the receiver of her teleunit, slamming her hand on a button and talking quickly to the person on the other hand. Grimacing, Dash held up her hands and backed away, quickly ducking around to head toward the east side of the building. Looking up at the ivory surface of the tower, she began latching her gear onto the sleek surface. \u201cYou\u2019d think they\u2019d have learned how to stop me by now, Dash muttered to herself as she slowly began to scale the side of the building. \u201c\u2018Specially after last time.\u201d She spared a glance at the tracking device. \u201cI really hope that my calibrations were correct.\u201d As she drew closer to the 47th floor, she felt the metal begin to vibrate underneath her palms. Slowly, Dash peeked over the edge of the window frame, peering into the laboratory within. The walls were lined with shelves displaying different kinds of ore, metals and minerals, each carefully labelled, along with a collection of analytical tools and geological devices. A scientist rushed past her, heading in the direction of the elevator. As he passed, he revealed the massive laser standing in the center of the room, pointed directly at a large chunk of tenatan ore, its magnified beam growing stronger with each passing second. \u201cWho was responsible for this?\u201d The lead scientist roared, spittle flying from his lips as he whipped around to stare at the research assistant from the marketplace. Clad in his monogrammed Teklo coat, Wyverstone glared at her with steel-grey eyes, staring down the length of his hooked nose. \u201cClara!\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t- I swear, this isn\u2019t-\u201d Clara stuttered, raising her hands in front of her. Behind her, the chunk of tenatan ore seemed to almost shiver, shifting slightly on the metal surface. With a great, shuddering boom, the room exploded in a cloud of bright blue dust. A small tenatan fragment flew toward the window, bouncing off the glass with a sharp ping. Wyverstone stared blankly at his surroundings, face pale, one eye twitching. Every individual in the room looked down to find themselves coated in a layer of bright blue, almost completely concealing the clothing beneath. For a moment, all was silent. Then, a peal of laughter shattered the tentative quiet. As one, the group of scientists turned toward the window, greeted with the sight of the small mechanologist\u2019s face pressed up against the glass. Beneath the fine layer of bright blue, Wyverstone\u2019s face darkened, turning an unhealthy shade of purple. \u201cYou!\u201d He withdrew a laser pistol from one of the drawers, raising it to fire at Dash. Throwing a hand over her mouth, she frantically shook her head. \u201cHang on a second! I swear, it wasn\u2019t intentional this time!\u201d \u201cWasn\u2019t intentional,\u201d Wyverstone roared, firing in Dash\u2019s direction. \u201cSomeone bring me that brat right now! Somebody call Thiroux and tell her to control her daughter! No, call Teklo- Call the Iron Council! Bring me my phone this instant\u2026!\u201d   Dash grimaced as the man continued raving, waving her fingers sheepishly at the occupants of the room as she ducked out of view, beginning to descend down the face of the Needle. Her feet touched the ground just as the front doors burst open, revealing Wyverstone standing in the entranceway, several staff members standing just behind him. Turning on her heel, Dash made for the nearest aperture, ducking down into the city level below.",

Born of dragonblood lineage, the two were separated as children during the chaos of an insurrection that split the land and tore families asunder.

The reunion was as the striking of flint against steel, sparks of past memories and the glow of potential future alliances igniting between them. Fai, draped in the garb of his insurgent followers, met her gaze with a tempered mix of suspicion and recognition.\n\nThe conversation between them was terse, filled with the tension of a drawn bowstring. Dromai spoke first, her voice as steady as the magma flows from Mt. Volcor, \"Fai, I have come not as a foe, but as kin. Our world is changing, and we stand at the edge of a new era.\"\n\nHer words hovered in the air, thick with the scent of impending rain that never graced the volcanic region. Fai's hand instinctively went to the hilt of his sword, a gesture born of his tumultuous life, \"And what role would you have us play in this new era, sister?\"\n\nDromai's gaze never wavered, \"Together, we can reforge the world that once cast us apart. Our bloodline gives us power, yes, but it is our unity that will forge a new path for Volcor.\"\n\nThere, amidst the endless sands and the whispers of their ancestors carried by the hot winds, the siblings found a fragile common ground. Dromai extended her hand, not as an Illusionist to a Ninja, but as a sister to a brother. Fai regarded it for a moment that seemed to stretch across the expanse of their shared history before accepting it.\n\nThe reunion of Dromai and Fai was not a promise of peace\u2014peace was a luxury the unforgiving land of Volcor seldom afforded\u2014but a declaration of a newfound alliance. In a world where trust was as elusive as the shifting dunes and every shadow could conceal a blade, the siblings chose to stand together, united by blood and the indomitable will to shape their destiny.\n\nUnder the blood-orange sky, the flames of rebellion and the art of illusion combined to light the way forward.

The seedling slowly grew into a beautiful cherry blossom tree, bright and cheerful in its place high above, looking down on the village that began to take shape below. Mistress Ikaru, once a mysterious stranger, took a name in honour of the tree that now watched over her home. The House of Blossoms flourished under her careful guidance, growing from a tiny village into a house worthy of its founder. Long after the Mistress took her last breath, the Ikaru Clan would continue to grow, thriving under the branches of the cherry blossom tree.",
        "Villages and towns lie hidden amongst the mountains, close-knit communities following ancient traditions. The treacherous landscape hides these villages from outsiders, a thick blanket of mist concealing the buildings from view. Individual houses hang between the cliffs, suspended from massive networks of rope that can support the weight of entire villages. Larger communal buildings are carved into the mountainside - taverns, inns, teahouses, dojos, spaces for markets and shops, as well as places to eat, and spaces for sparring.",
        "The Blackjack\u2019s Tavern is well-known throughout the Pits, not only for the drinks they serve, but for the services that Blackjack\u2019s provide. The Tavern is the central hub of the Blackjack\u2019s Mercenary Group, the largest mercenary organisation in Rathe.",
        "Despite the difficulties of living in such a place, Misterians would argue that the beauty and tranquillity of their home more than makes up for any inconvenience. Their hard work and dedication are rewarded with the experience of living in one of the most beautiful environments in all of Rathe.",
        "The city of Solana stands tall amidst the golden fields, at the very heart of Rathe; it is a radiant beacon for all to follow. Its soaring stone walls glitter in the light of the sun as it watches over its outlying villages like a stalwart guardian. It shepherds its charges along the path of the Light. Through its grand gates lie shining city streets, lined with banners of white and gold.",
        "The palace of the royal court sits on the banks of Mt Volcor, high above the conflict that plagues the rest of the region. Carved deep into the bedrock, the palace is home to the Emperor and the Royal Family, housing all those who live to serve them. From the court wizards to lord generals, grand strategists to consorts, the Emperor is served and protected by some of the most powerful individuals in Volcor.",
        "Dromai sits in the Oasis, her feet dangling in the cave\u2019s simmering lake. She watches luminous carp flit through the water, hunting flarefish that fall from the lava river. The water comes from Misteria. The lava comes from Mount Volcor. Here water and lava meet, a union of opposing forces, just like her. She delivered General Riku to Ashvahan. The Royal Court gave her the mantle of Dracai in return. For a time there, she even allowed herself to celebrate, to luxuriate in the trappings of palace life. Then came the messenger in the night, from Xathari. \u201cI have found Eun. Time is of the essence.\u201d In fact, time was their enemy. Eagerness for the future, that is what drove them into Fai\u2019s trap. Shame at the past, that is what unleashed her fury. Dromai spent years convincing herself of Min\u2019s guilt. Against her fond memories. Against her better instincts. She recited her foster mother\u2019s crime each and every night. Yet when blame was recast in truth, reforged in the blood and fire of the battlefield, she needed no persuasion. Only execution. Dromai has sought solace in the Oasis before. The ways are hidden, but she is more perceptive than most. She found her way through the mist and winding tunnels. It is a place of refuge. A place of clarity, where she can see through life as easily as she can see through the pristine waters. It gave her no pleasure to kill Eun. That surprises her. Justice has been served, and it has left her with nothing. Death is no honor for the dead. Xathari is a different matter. For ten years, he was her mentor, her confidante and friend.   He saved her from murderous rebels. Lies. He offered her a chance to redeem her bloodline. Lies. He gave her a home, a place where she could finally belong. All lies. Part of her wants to hate herself for being so naive, so stupid. But there is no shame in being deceived. Min told her that. The shame lies with the deceiver. Another part of her wants to find Fai, to aid him in his grand cause. But then she would be deceiving herself. She has no desire to be ruled by the people. The Volcai are not a power she respects. Like lava transformed to stone by cooling waters, Dromai feels her pain turn to resolve. Lies can teach just as well as truth. Better even. The spymaster taught her to unravel the secrets of the arcane, to uncover and use the secrets of the court. He led her down the twisting Way of the Dracai and made her realize it is the only path worth traveling. Dromai lifts her feet from the water and stands on the lakeshore, taking in the cave\u2019s beauty. Its crystals. Its luscious flowers. She breathes deep of the steam and rich scents, committing them to memory. Her future is perilous. She may never come back here. She thinks as she walks, the movement of her feet helps her mind roam free. Only she and Fai survived the ambush. He can shoulder the blame for Xathari\u2019s death. It might even help him add a little fire to his reputation. Fai of the Forest of Flames, Slayer of Dracai. In turn, Xathari\u2019s demise will aid in hers. In the spymaster\u2019s name, in the memory of his tragic passing, she will gain an audience with the Emperor. She rescued the Emperor\u2019s pet general and slew the rebellion\u2019s most notorious leader. The court will remember her name. Doors will open. She will offer favors. She will collect secrets. Step by step, the Way of the Dracai will lead her to where she deserves to be. She will never belong to Ashvahan. Ashvahan will belong to her.",
        "An ancient primal wilderness, the Savage Lands is a jungle that sprawls far to the west of Rathe. This seemingly endless expanse of dense woodland is unrepresented by any map, due to its sheer size and the dangers that lie within. It remains untouched by the passage of time, as generations of humans try and fail to tame or settle any part of the vast jungle.",
        "For the first time, victory is within their reach. In overthrowing Solana, they will finally rid themselves of their greatest enemy, and once again claim their rightful place within the lands of Rathe. Should they succeed, there will be nothing left to stand in their way, and the residents of the Demonastery will at long last be free to pursue their aims unchecked.",
        "The Hero's name is Bravo. They have the following short description: It's been years since the skirmish at the Fractal Scar, and the call to arms you answered that fateful day. As the charismatic and handsome ringmaster of the Legendarium, your time (in-between shows) had been well spent honing your newfound power, the power of the Flow that now coursed within your veins!But everywhere you looked, the Everfest was rocking, and the patrons were having a blast! The shadows of that day, it seemed, had melted away.Every ruckus you hear, just the sound of a drunken patron. Every bang, every explosion, a wayward firework or a poorly barrelled keg. The roar of the crowd, the anticipation of the encore, and the exhilaration of the finale is almost enough to coax you back into a life of joyful carelessness. A life of comfort that you knew all too well.Except for these rainbow strands of the Flow that coursed through your veins, within them you felt an ancient calling, and the weight of many solemn oaths. They whispered gently beside your ears, reminding you of a looming threat that is yet to be revealed.Until one day, at long last, an oddball party of misfits arrived at your doorstep.And the rest, as they say, is.... Their Talent/Class is Elemental Guardian. Personality: Charismatic, Protective, Adventurous, Resolute, Empathetic, Artistic, and a Tendency for Carelessness.  Bravo is the epitome of charisma, effortlessly drawing others toward him with his magnetic presence and compelling performances. His protective nature is evident in his role as an Elemental Guardian, always quick to shield others from harm, be it on the stage of the Everfest Carnival or the battlegrounds of Rathe. A lover of adventure, Bravo thrives on the thrill of the unknown, his curious spirit and hunger for untold stories leading him to seek out new experiences and challenges.  While he exudes confidence, his resolute determination to stand against looming threats and fulfill his oaths speaks to a deep sense of responsibility and courage. Bravo's empathy shines through his interactions, as he listens to the tales of Aria and connects with his audience and companions on a profound level, ensuring no one feels overlooked. His artistic flair is not just limited to his performances but extends to his approach to life, viewing every moment as an opportunity to craft a narrative full of wonder and excitement.  However, Bravo's inclination toward a carefree lifestyle occasionally surfaces, hinting at an underlying struggle to balance his joyful showmanship with the serious call of duty. This slight tendency for carelessness, often masked by his larger-than-life persona, suggests a complex character who must continually reconcile his past with his destiny as a leader and protector.",
        "The uninitiated cannot see the black moon rise over the Demonastery. It mirrors the nighttide, pulsing starward with its invisible light, witnessed only by those anointed in Shadow. Those like Vynnset, the Iron Maiden. *** \u201cLife is suffering. Life is sacrifice,\u201d intones Vynnset. \u201cThe sacrifice of today to save the suffering of tomorrow.\u201d A dozen faceless creatures rub up against the Iron Maiden\u2019s armor, clawing at the hard floor like cats kneading a blanket. Her piercings grow warm, thawing thechill of the ritual chamber. In her pallid flesh, power resonates from metal to bone. Her creatures feel it too\u2014the anticipation of bloodshed and retribution. \u201cDrops to moisten the clay, to raise a dam against the flood, lest the sanguine river drown us all.\u201d Vynnset straightens, fixing her metal tunic in place for the coming rite, the past welling in her mind like blood from a fresh wound. She remembers back to when she was... ...a little girl with flaxen hair sits cross-legged in a wheat field. She cocks her head, listening, then giggles.   \u201cYou\u2019re naughty, Ren.\u201d A look of worry passes over her face like a cloud crossing the sun. \u201cSol is always listening.\u201d A lady dressed in white and gold crouches nearby, concealed by long stalks of golden wheat. She too listens, this Solanian lady of means, her expression troubled, growing more fearful by the moment. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Ren.\u201d The girl giggles again. \u201cSol should mind its own beeswax.\u201d The lady stands. She\u2019s heard enough. The girl looks up, suddenly afraid. The sun blazes down upon her. She tries to raise her hands to cover her eyes. They won\u2019t move. She screams. \u201cBe silent, child!\u201d orders the scholar. The girl struggles in the chair, but the buckled straps hold her tight. Tears stream down her cheeks as the scholar brings the arcane lamp closer. Her face contorts as she tries to close her eyes\u2014a hopeless attempt\u2014pinned open as they are by contraptions of silver and brass.   \u201cA shadow lurks in the recesses of her mind,\u201d shouts the scholar, raising his voice over the girl\u2019s cries. \u201cWe must exorcize it.\u201d He looks to the lady of means and meets her tearful gaze. \u201cWithout delay.\u201d Strong hands grasp the girl\u2019s arms. The lady of means bows her head. \u201cMother, please!\u201d The lady moves her lips in silent prayer, deaf to her daughter\u2019s pleas. Robed matrons carry the girl through a marble archway; Sisters of Octothesia taking the poor wretch into their sanctified care. Only they can cleanse her mind and purify her soul in the Light of Sol. Her shaved head lolls in the blazing sun, scalp shining with sweat. Her skin is red and blistered, her lips shriveled with dehydration. She lies spread eagle, hands and wrists tethered to stakes that are driven deep into the bare earth.   \u201cDon\u2019t leave me,\u201d she croaks. \u201cNever leave me.\u201d Her thin frame relaxes at the answer only she can hear. Not the prayers, not the merciless sisters, not the burning Light of Sol\u2014nothing can take that from her. Flesh may burn, but her soul remains wrapped in a cooling darkness. As cool as the night she slips through, her bare feet padding softly on the polished floor. Years of waiting, and of failed attempts at escape. In that time, she has emerged from childhood into womanhood. The senior matrons rush to an \u2018accident\u2019, leaving their duties to a few inexperienced acolytes. After being watched for so long, the space is palpable; the matron\u2019s domineering eyeballs cast elsewhere. She freezes at a corner, concealed in shadow, as a pair of gossiping novitiates rustle down the corridor ahead. \u201cThanks, Ren,\u201d she whispers. \u201cThey won\u2019t catch us this time.\u201d She uses a stolen key to unlock a side door, and flits like a ghost down the alley to a moonlit courtyard. As hoped, the guards at the wagon are too busy tying down their load to notice the young woman. She squeezes into a gap between stacked breast plates, turns to smile at a shade sitting beside her, identical in size and shape, as the wagon rolls out of Solana. The wagon stops in a clearing where axes have hewn the ancient trees to stumps. The guards eye the surrounding forest with suspicion. This is the Savage Lands. Where death is but a tooth or claw away. A knight pulls up the cover to check the cargo and is startled to find a stowaway where he expected only greaves and helms. \u201cPlease,\u201d she rasps, her voice dry with dust and disuse. \u201cDon\u2019t send me back.\u201d He offers what he thinks is a reassuring smile and reaches with a gauntleted hand to help the young woman down. But she has not experienced kindness in years. She has forgotten what it looks like. The knight shrieks with pain as a heavy shield falls from the load, crushing his wrist. The woman clambers down the injured man like he is a ladder and turns to face the advancing guards.   \u201cI\u2019m NOT going back!\u201d Black smoke rises from her slender body. Her eyes are pools of deepest shadow. She dances in the dirt, a dreadful dirge. The guards sweat as the air grows hot, coughing as their breath turns acrid. A low keening escapes the woman\u2019s narrow throat, so subtle yet so piercing that the guards wince, some covering their ears as the song drives spikes of pain through their skulls. The wagon\u2019s cargo answers to that music. Shields and breast plates rise. Helms roll and gauntlets crawl on jingling fingers. Disembodied pieces form hollow knights that lash out with all the woman\u2019s anger and hurt. Years of judgment and torment, meted out with metallic might. The guards try to defend themselves, but one by one they fall, beaten into a bloody pulp.   One guard lives longer than the rest, though no one would count him luckier. The woman draws his dagger and slashes the buckles of his armor, stripping him naked in the noonday sun. He wails as she carves jagged runes into his broken limbs and shattered chest. \u201cA sanguine river flows.\u201d The words susurrate from her tongue, distant, unearthly. Not hers, but the echo of another, carrying up through her throat as if from some abandoned well. \u201cIn the valley of sorrow where flesh of a world presses to flesh of a dream.\u201d The voice grows louder, striking an accord of its own while the woman paints symbols upon her skin in visceral red. \u201cA bridge of bone, tethered in vein, where only pain may cross from life to lethe.\u201d She licks her bloodied fingers with the tip of her tongue. \u201cI pay this tithe to souls bereft.\u201d She closes her mouth and swallows deeply. When her lips open, it is her own words she imparts. \u201cI am ready, Ren.\u201d She raises the dagger to her face, not a tremble in her hand, and bursts her eyes with its finely honed point. \u201cReady to see.\u201d With unfaltering precision, she drives the dagger into the guard\u2019s heart. The blood boils up from his chest, more than his body could ever contain, flooding, drowning, until it is a rich, red pool into which the woman wades.   From that wound in reality, she emerges onto a mountaintop of inky blackness. From the nebulous sky stares a great black moon. And from that scrutinizing orb descends a creature of terrifying beauty. The woman sees it and more, and the truth of seeing makes her weep red tears of rapture from her blood-filled sockets. \u201cRen?\u201d Cool air dries her drenched skin, calming her fevered flesh. The pain fades from the ruins of her eyes as understanding awakens in her soul. \u201cSoul Harrower,\u201d she states, her voice growing softer as the sanguine river carries her back. \u201cNasreth.\u201d The present returns with immaculate agony. Vynnset\u2019s piercings burn in her sinews. Words of otherworldly suffering seep from her tongue. Her creatures stretch and dance in waves of lapping pain. \u201cWhere flesh meets flesh, upon the bridge of bone, I now walk in the dusk of absolution. Embraced in night, I rise untold, to deny the break of dawn.\u201d The Iron Maiden rests her palms on the rune-carved stones before her. Rivulets of shadow pour through her armor, amethyst in hue, radiant as the black moon. \u201cYes, Nasreth. I am ready.\u201d Vynnset draws a curved blade from her belt.   \u201cReady to free the Shadow.\u201d Written by Edwin McRae and Rachel Rees.

        "Rays of golden sun kiss the once golden fields of Solana. A cloaked figure pauses at the doorway of a ruined homestead, eyes lost in shadow as it looks across the embattled earth. The clamoring horde of the Demonastery is a chorus of rumbles and howls, like a foul storm brooding in the distance. The figure checks for onlookers before darting into the war-torn house. Safe from prying eyes, it removes its fiendish mask. Its looming stature shrinks, its claws retract and soften, and its lean sinews contract and reform, sculpting an elegant new body sheathed in gold and pearl. Shiyana steps from the crumpled cloak of the hideous old with a sigh of relief. She picks her way through the scattered bones of the home\u2019s inhabitants. Enough bones for a large family, scored with teeth marks, broken and sucked empty of their marrow. She looks through a shattered window at the Solarium in the distance, elegant in its radiance, and the comforting boundary of the Great Gates. It is a welcome sight after the boiling harshness of Volcor, after the raging fires of a land at war with itself. Against the corruption that besieges it, Solana remains graceful; a bastion of order and beauty. It feels good to be home again, once more basking in the glow of a lighthouse, safe from the intrigues and conflicts she has survived for duty and devotion. She crosses the bare and bloodied soil to the Solanian battle line where the city\u2019s surviving warriors defend the remaining farms and villages. Hands raised, she addresses the sentries, requesting they present her to their commander. Suspicious, swords at the ready, the warriors lead her into a stately marquee of cream canvas, golden banners fluttering from its whitewashed poles. The commander looks up from the map he has spread across a long table. His eyes are bloodshot with exhaustion, his normally shining armor scratched and smeared with gore. \u201cGemini Shiyana,\u201d he greets her with a weary smile. \u201cYou are as welcome as the dawn.\u201d \u201cBoltyn, it is good to see you.\u201d \u201cIf only it were under more cordial circumstances.\u201d \u201cThe light will prevail.\u201d \u201cYou bring fair news, then?\u201d She can sense his pain, the longing for hope. For his son, Aios. For the righteous many. Anything to fill the void left by the death of his beloved. His Eirina. \u201cSome.\u201d She hopes Sol will forgive her the lie. \u201cFor the Magisters\u2019 ears only.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll arrange an honor guard.\u201d \u201cBetter that I avoid attention.\u201d Boltyn dismisses the guards with a wave of his hand. Shiyana places her mask on her face, transforming before Boltyn into a Solanian farmer, her smock filthy, her broad face streaked with dirt and blood, her dun brown hair lank against her skull. \u201cThey are in the Council Chamber?\u201d she asks. \u201cIndeed. The Magisters sit to decide the fate of this year\u2019s Solstice of Laurels. Our knights rightly deserve the Blessing of Sol, but some view the ceremony as an extravagance in these times.\u201d Shiyana respectfully takes her leave before Bolton has a chance to grasp at the unrest she holds at bay. She joins the ragged procession of refugees entering the city through the southern gate, weaving through the crowd of the wounded and the homeless lying prone along the city\u2019s grand walkway. She expects to see despair. Instead, she witnesses kindness, bravery\u2014people who continue to give when all has been taken from them. Their benevolence touches her, Sol\u2019s divine light growing the closer she gets to the Solarium. In a vacant entryway she removes her mask, thus returning to her natural form. She whispers a poem as she steps from sandstone to solid marble, into the Great Hall of the Solarium, the cadence of her footsteps matching syllables from the refrain. \u201cBefore the light of Sol, we stand,The one true guide, illumined in our hearts,Blessings of hope eternal against this unholy world,We are yours, Children of the Light,And in your glory, we shall prevail.\u201d \u201cSol will prevail,\u201d she chants to herself, the strength of her voice ringing from the arches of marble and gold above. As she nears the Amphitheater, she has to shield her eyes against the brightness of the Grand Council chamber and the congregation of Magisters seated at its center. It seems like an age since these paragons last received her, radiant in their magnificent masks and mantles. In their presence, her anxiety recedes. Their light anoints her with hope. The Librarian\u2014Magister of History\u2014is the first to notice her arrival. They turn to The Steadfast\u2014the fifth and wisest Grand Magister to lead and guide Solana\u2014and await permission to announce Shiyana\u2019s return. Shiyana shivers as The Steadfast\u2019s gaze passes over her, every fiber of her being drawn to them like a flower that follows the arc of the sun. The Steadfast nods their approval and The Librarian beckons Shiyana forward. \u201cWe welcome the brightest and boldest of our Gemini,\u201d heralds The Librarian, \u201cand give thanks to Sol for her safe return.\u201d Shiyana raises her hand, her diamond spinning over her palm, and bows deeply, as is the custom. \u201cI serve in the Light.\u201d \u201cFor in the Light we are blessed,\u201d completes The Grand Council as one. \u201cHow stands Volcor?\u201d asks The Ambassador\u2014Magister of Diplomacy. \u201cNeither for us nor against us, your Grace. Their\u2014\u201d She pauses to order her thoughts. Should she burden the council with the convictions of the Phoenix? The rebel leader has vowed to fight on until Volcor is remade. What of Lady Dromai and the Royal Court, fighting amongst themselves while their land burns? \u201cTheir concerns are their own, your Grace.\u201d \u201cYou spoke with the Emperor, did you not?\u201d Even awash with the light of the Magisters, Shiyana can feel apprehension lurking, waiting for its moment to retake her. \u201cThe Emperor is dead. Slain by an assassin.\u201d She expects a chorus of surprise at the mention of it. But the chamber remains silent, not the faintest tremor of unsettlement to be heard. The Grand Magister looks upon Shiyana with a tranquil resolve that washes over her, warm and gentle, just how she remembers the waters of her own baptism as a tender child. \u201cContinue,\u201d speaks The Steadfast, a mere whisper that fills the Amphitheatre, ringing through the stone beneath Shiyana\u2019s feet, as if that lone word had resonated up from the deep foundations of Solana itself. Like echoes to The Steadfast\u2019s cadence, Shiyana\u2019s words ring out of their own accord. She spins her summations, woven as they are from tenuous threads, unfolding a tapestry of tragedy. As a chambermaid, she witnessed the murderous rivalry between the Ezu and Alshoni; Dracai factions locked in a dynastic struggle. As a healer, she patched the wounds and listened to the stories of rebels under the banner of the Phoenix. As a scribe, she copied the words of Spymaster Xathari until his untimely demise. As General Riku\u2019s personal aide, she finally snagged a hole in this arras of silence. A symbol upon a seemingly banal parchment. A sign she recognized from a long ago mission in the depths of the Pits. L\u2019Apocalypta. A cult sworn to unspeakable acts for unknowable reasons. Shiyana speaks of the assassination itself. Posed as a lieutenant of the Royal Guard, she was among the first to hear Lady Dromai\u2019s cry of alarm. She glimpsed the carnage within the throne room, reeled at the raw stench of wanton massacre. But that was nothing to the almighty roar that followed, a sonance so deafening, so profound, it was as if Mount Volcor itself wailed in anguish at the loss of its chosen son. \u201cI know not if it was consequence or coincidence, harbinger or happenstance, yet all of Volcor suffered in the wake of that outcry. The earth was sundered. Lava rivers broke their banks.\u201d \u201cNot unusual for Volcor,\u201d dismisses The Bastion\u2014Magister of Defense. \u201cIt is a land of volatile firmament.\u201d \u201cTrue, your Grace. Yet the suddenness, the violent scale, was beyond anything noted by the imperial historians. And there was something else. A sensation I have experienced many times, but never under such circumstances.\u201d The Librarian leans forward, expectant. \u201cDo explain.\u201d \u201cWhen I don my mask, when I change, I feel a ripple in the aether, as if I am a stone dropped into a pool of water. It is gentle, almost pleasant. This was the same, although much stronger, and not of my volition.\u201d She shudders at the memory. \u201cThe aether answered that ardent call and wreaked havoc in its wake.\u201d \u201cIt is as we foretold,\u201d states The Librarian, their surety punctuated by the briefest of glances from The Steadfast. \u201cBefore the words, before belief, they slumbered in the bygone lethe, breeding dreams in twilife\u2019s gloom, until the awakening of i\u2019Arathael\u2019s doom.\u201d The Librarian\u2019s verse renders Shiyana speechless. How blind she has been despite the keenness of her eyes. How dim her thoughts are against The Grand Council\u2019s all-knowing presence. As if sensing the crack in Shiyana\u2019s confidence, The Steadfast raises their hand. It is a gesture befitting The Grand Magister alone, demanding patience and forbearance. Silence stretches out, growing weightier and more suffocating with every passing moment. The Amphitheater, indeed the entire Solarium, holds its breath. \u201cThrough the gathering dusk shall Sol\u2019s light burn ever brighter.\u201d The Grand Magister\u2019s words shatter the silence like the sun breaking through a mantle of cloud. They turn to Shiyana, their blazing eyes searing through Shiyana\u2019s mind. Her petty ego scurries and squirms, trying to hide, trying to escape The Steadfast\u2019s ineluctable gaze. It cannot. One by one, her precious anxieties melt away, executed in iridescence. She is forged anew, impurities exorcized. A servant, an instrument, devoted to the glory of Sol. \u201cIn the shade of destiny, devious minds hatch deviant dreams,\u201d intones The Librarian, slow and stately as the rising sun. \u201cThe schemes they brew are poisoned with greed and malice.

        "Featuring illustrations by MJ Fetesio. Story by Nicola Price.   For hundreds of years, the Demonastery lurked beyond the shores of Rathe, surrounded by a wall of thick sea fog. Stormy seas kept ships from ever reaching its shores, surging waves tossing would-be intruders onto the sharp rocks. An eerie silence blanketed the grounds, stifling the distant sounds of the ocean. T'was a place that is neither here nor there, a dark sanctuary free from the bounds of morality.   Two massive wrought-iron gates lead into a courtyard carved from marbled stone. While the stone paving is worn and stained, the inscribed runes were still visible, illuminated by the pale moonlight. Just beyond the courtyard lies the manor itself, looming over the grounds like a vengeful apparition. The Demonastery itself is a large and imposing series of stone buildings, with great stained glass windows, massive towers and grand spires. Gargoyles hang between the eaves, their grotesque faces twisted into expressions of agony. The main doorway is guarded by two massive statues, their carved wings mirroring one another in a dance of light and dark. Their crossed blades form an arch over the entrance way, locked in eternal battle. Inside the manor, a figure stalked through the halls, passing a series of stained glass windows. The dark metal armour he wore flashed silver in the moonlight, slivers of amethyst glistening through the gaps in the metal. The air around him seemed heavy, stifling, thick and oppressive with the weight of dark arcane energy. A helm hid his face from view, sealing the appearance of the inhuman being behind a wall of solid metal, violet light shining through the slits in his visor. As he continued down the hall, his head slowly turned to one side; the practiced, careful movements of a predator stalking his prey. The figure seemed to almost glide across the floor, an unnatural gait revealing his inhuman nature. Despite his heavy armour, he moved almost silently, his head turning as he scanned the hallway from left to right. Only the dust collecting on the edges of his torn cloak suggested the passage of time, as the Arknight searched the depths of the Demonastery. No stone left unturned, no room left untouched, he scoured the ancient mansion from floor to ceiling. Yet so far, his quarry eluded him, a creature just as nebulous and evasive as himself. In this, they were alike, numbering among the strange and frightening entities that haunted the residents of the Demonastery.   However, unlike the creature he now hunted, Viserai\u2019s existence was explained. Lord Sutcliffe was his creator, his master, without whom he would not exist. The Arknight remembered little of the ritual that gave him new life, left only with fragments of memories shattered by blinding pain. This other creature was far older, presumably one of many borne from ill-fated experiments, whose creator had long since passed. The other creature was an accident, while Viserai was designed, a success in every sense of the word. The tests were proof enough of that. Viserai had passed all of Lord Sutcliffe\u2019s tests thus far, procuring useful items and knowledge from around the Demonastery, aiding his research and proving his usefulness to the Lord. Retrieving a sample of this strange creature, an alchemical anomaly incapable of dying, was just one more test for Viserai. In this, as in all things, he obeyed the will of his master. The sound of a shrill scream echoed down the hall, shattering the unnatural silence. Drawing his sword from its sheath, Viserai stalked toward the source of the sound, imbuing the enchanted blade with arcane energy. Aether filled the cracks in the metal, strengthening the sword beyond the limits of any ordinary blade. An eerie glow illuminated the hall as Viserai approached the source of the sound, the last few notes of the scream echoing into the darkness. Through the open doorway, an amorphous shadow hung in the inky darkness, looming the body of an alchemist. A beaker lay on the ground next to his outstretched hand, shattered upon the floor, its contents seeping into the cracks in the stone. The shadow came into focus as the creature slowly lifted one of its heads, releasing a metallic, shrieking gurgle. Its body began to shift, reshaping, lurching over the corpse.   Viserai\u2019s runic markings flared to life, aether escaping through the vents in his armour as he drew upon the arcane energy within. With a wave of his hand, he summoned a runechant into the air, illuminating the room with a white-violet glow. A sharp crack echoed off the walls as the arcane energy burst forth, a bolt of pure aether striking the creature, its flesh sizzling and crackling on contact with the arcane energy. Lifting the sword with both hands, Viserai swung, the aetheric blade leaving a trail of light as he slashed at the creature. It slipped out of reach of his sword, hissing wildly as it threw itself at him. Its claws slashed just next to his head as Viserai slammed a gauntleted arm between them, shoving the creature back. As it collided with the floor, it seemed to almost fold in on itself, body turning to a liquid smoke and melting through the cracks in the floor. With one last wisp of vapour, it disappeared. Viserai held his blade at the ready, summoning another runechant. The light of the runechant hung in the air, illuminating the space around him. A raised hand kept the arcane energy at bay, waiting for the right moment to strike. For a long moment, all was still, silent save for the faint hiss of the runechant. Then, on the far wall, a shadow suddenly formed, and the creature leapt out at Viserai. Its claws scraped along his armour, the shriek of claw on metal filling the room as it slashed at Viserai. Striking out with the sharp pommel of his blade, Viserai loosed the runechant, allowing the bolt of aether to strike the creature in its side. Another three runechants sparked to life, snapping through the air, striking the creature again and again. It shrieked at him as its flesh hissed and crackled, dissolving from the fresh burn in its side, and threw itself at him with an indignant howl. Viserai swung his blade, slashing at the creature, and as it drew back in preparation for another attack, he lopped off one of its heads in a single swing. The decapitated head collided with the floor with a dull thunk, hissing and bubbling as it evaporated into thin air. Some of its matter dripped onto the stone floor from its open wounds, staining the floor inky black and crimson. Incensed, it lunged at him once again, wrapping its teeth around his gauntleted forearm. With his free hand, Viserai loosed another runechant, watching as the arcane energy struck the creature directly. It howled in agony, writhing, dripping melted flesh onto the stone tiles, and with final screech, it dissolved into the shadows; wounded, but alive. Nothing ever truly dies around here. Quickly sheathing his sword, Viserai withdrew a small glass vial, scooping up some of the creature\u2019s melted flesh and sealing the vial closed. As he did so, he felt the tug of the master\u2019s command, compelling him to return to Lord Sutcliffe. Turning his back on the alchemist\u2019s body, he began to make his way back down the hall. The Demonastery was silent once more, Viserai\u2019s quiet footsteps echoing off the walls. While it wasn\u2019t unusual to find a resident outside of their rooms, most only stepped outside of their own territory if it was absolutely necessary, each absorbed in their own individual studies and experiments. Some of the residents had someone (or more commonly, something) to fetch materials and ingredients for them, as Viserai did for Sutcliffe. As he passed the great doors leading to the entrance hall, Viserai paused, hearing a now familiar whisper echo into the air. Viserai\u2026 The heavy weight of Sutcliffe\u2019s command still pulled at him, compelling him to continue down the hallway. And yet\u2026 Viserai placed a hand on the door in front of him and pushed it open, entering the main hall. The sconces were all lit, casting the grand stonework in an ethereal glow. The ceiling soared high above, great chandeliers hanging between the rib-vaults. A grand statue stood at the center of the hall, towering over the polished floors. It depicted a man wearing dark robes embroidered with gold, an elaborately embellished hood hiding his face from view. Tendrils of fabric hung from his headwear, curving around him in half-circles. Dozens of weapons were carved from the stone at his feet, several helms lying directly below him, their faces carved into masks. Closer. Viserai turned, coming to a stand before a massive stained glass window at the far end of the hall, staring up at the illuminated glass panels. The vivid blues and soft violets shone with the pale light of the moon, a woman standing at the center with her face turned away from the light. Her dark hair was encircled by a golden halo, her eyes covered by a strand of hair, curling in a non-existent breeze. The living weapon approaches at last. The voice seemed to anticipate his response, continuing after a beat of silence. The residents of this place call me Whisper. I offer advice to those willing to listen, a warning to those who would choose to remain blind. Which are you, I wonder? When he made no move to leave, watching the stained glass from behind his helm, he heard a breathy chuckle. Listen well, Arknight. Beware the man born into power, who abandoned his people to pursue the Arcane Arts. He who, even now, seeks power to rival the Aesirs themselves. He who would bend and break the laws of this world as he sees fit. No amount of power shall ever be enough to satisfy his desires. A mere weapon is nothing to a god; a tool to be used as he sees fit, kept on a short leash. However, the leash may yet be more fragile than it first appears. There was once a human behind the armour, and he may be there still. Humans are conduits for change. From the day they are born, they are ever-changing from one day to the next. Find the chinks in his armour, or someone else may find them first.   Lord Sutcliffe raised the vial up to the light, peering thoughtfully at its contents. The master was an older man, with sharp cheekbones and narrow eyes, his angular face framed by loose, chin-length graying hair. His green eyes crinkled at the corners as he stared at the sample, frowning. \u201cThis is a little less than I would have liked, but it\u2019ll suffice.\u201d Tucking the vial into his jacket, Lord Sutcliffe turned toward Viserai, mouth curled into a faint scowl. \u201cThere is a woman named Corva who keeps her research notes in a tome, which she carries on her at all times. Bring me the tome. She sometimes conducts her rituals outdoors, near the offal pit. Begin there.\u201d Viserai felt the familiar sensation of the command taking root, the compulsion driving him to leave the room. As he turned his back on Sutcliffe, walking toward the door, the master\u2019s voice stopped him. \u201cAnd Viserai?\u201d The Arknight turned to face Lord Sutcliffe, noting the cold gleam in his eyes. \u201cDo not open the tome.\u201d For just a moment, Viserai could almost have believed that Lord Sutcliffe\u2019s pale green eyes were staring straight past the armour, looking into his mind to see the memory of Whisper\u2019s warning. However, Viserai was not human, and so did not irrationally believe that Sutcliffe could read his mind. With a quick, brief nod, Viserai turned and exited the room. A tool to be used as he sees fit, kept on a tight leash. The echo of Whisper\u2019s voice sounded in his mind, though it rang hollow with the tone of a memory. Viserai pushed the thought away, focusing instead on the flow of aether within his body, travelling between the flesh-bound runes. Weaving his way through the hallways of the Demonastery, Viserai ignored the scuttle of passing vidus, the tiny constructs who acted as custodians of the manor. Several of them were returning from the direction of the entrance hall, still marked with bloodstains. More than likely, they\u2019d just returned from cleaning up his mess from earlier. None of them paid any attention to the Arknight as he passed by, slipping into the entrance hall and out onto the manor\u2019s grounds. The grounds were a pale silver in the light of the crescent moon, only barely visible in the dark of night. Still, Viserai continued onward, the master\u2019s command driving him toward the offal pit. While the Lord Sutcliffe\u2019s ritual had destroyed his ability to smell, he could imagine the scent in the air as he drew closer; the sharp, rancid odor of decaying flesh. The memory - if that\u2019s what it was - was strong enough that Viserai could almost smell it. The faint glow of candle flames in the distance caught his attention, flickering faintly through the mists. A figure appeared amongst the shadows, almost completely masked by the surrounding fog. As Viserai drew closer, he could see the scene illuminated by the eerie light of a runic circle, carved into the solid earth. About her lay a range of detached heads in various stages of decay, eyes carved from their skills, their gaping, bloody sockets left empty.   Corva\u2019s face was distorted by a wide grin, stretching almost ear to ear. Her eyes gleamed with unrestrained glee, blood smeared down her chin. A series of runes were painted on her skin in dark, congealed blood, matching the ones on the ground below her, while an open wound on her arm allowed blood to flow freely down her outstretched arm, dripping onto the freshly carved runes. Drawing his sword, Viserai stalked closer, arcane energy beginning to collect in the runic channels along his skin. A peal of laughter cut through the night air as Corva suddenly whipped her head to one side, her gaze meeting the indifferent profile of Viserai\u2019s helm. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for this\u2026 I listen to the others. They don\u2019t like Sutcliffe.\u201d Corva spoke quickly, rapid-fire, spitting the words into the open air. \u201cI don\u2019t like him either. Just some stupid mortal playing with things he doesn\u2019t understand.\u201d She laughed darkly as Viserai began to summon a series of runechants, her face contorting into a sneer. \u201cHe can\u2019t even cast a spell. No affinity! Has to have you to do it for him. It\u2019s not right, not right at all.\u201d The runechants burst into a bright flare of violet light, releasing a barrage of arcane energy, bolts striking the earth where Corva was standing mere moments before. She threw herself to one side, cackling wildly. \u201cMissed!\u201d With a bark of laughter, she threw her arms up in the air. The runes on her body and at her feet flared to life, flashing with a vibrant golden-red light, disturbing the fog around them. As the mists receded, Viserai\u2019s gaze was drawn to the pile of detached heads.They were shuddering, shaking, the hair on each one almost appearing to ripple as they collapsed to the ground. With a hair-raising screech, their faces suddenly contorted, mouths slamming open with a sickening crack as the jaws dislocated, skin splitting at the sides. The gleam of bone shone through as the skulls burst open, brain matter splattering against the earth. Great, disjointed limbs began to sprout from the remains, twisting and warping, the clawed tips slamming into the ground as they rose. The two empty eye sockets stretched into gaping maws, teeth sliding up to fill the voids. The tongues reshaped into great, barbed tendrils, snapping through the air with the crack of a whip. Eight newborn creatures came to a standstill, all turning to focus on Viserai. Behind them, Corva laughed and laughed, her teeth flashing in the light. Her creations towered over her, almost twice as tall as Viserai. Without a word, she flung out one hand, releasing a shrill laugh when the creatures leapt to follow her silent command. As the creatures raced toward him, Viserai summoned a series of runechants, hair raising on the back of his neck as the arcane energy burst into the still night air. The crackle and snap of pure aether echoed through the clearing as the attacks struck, sending several of the creatures slamming to the ground. Almost immediately, they righted themselves, rolling straight back onto their feet. Viserai raised his sword, twisting and slashing at the foremost creature. It released a high-pitched shriek as it slammed into the force of his blade, melded flesh parting easily beneath the sharp edge of the runic silversteel. One of its limbs fell to the earth, and the creature released a guttural wail as it threw itself at him, its claws slamming into his armour. Viserai flung it to one side, throwing it to the ground, runechants bursting to life above him as he swung at another fiend. The creatures swarmed around him, a sea of claws and teeth and gaping maws, screeching at the onslaught of arcane energy that tore through the air. Yet even as bolts of aether seared their flesh, they barely faltered, immediately rising and attacking once again. They writhed in and around one another, scuttling across the earth with surprising speed. Finally, Viserai dispatched one of the beasts, slicing it in half. The head fell to the earth with a dull thud, its body going still almost instantaneously. Without a moment\u2019s pause, Viserai immediately summoned another series of runechants, allowing the night air to turn bright violet as aether filled the clearing, swirling around him like mist. As a bolt of arcane energy struck down one of the creatures, Viserai closed in, channeling aether through the length of his blade. The remnants of the creature\u2019s skull burst open from the force of the blow, its body slumping to the earth with a dull thud. Running toward a third, he struck, cleaving its head from the rest of its body with a single swing. Turning to face the remaining fiends, he noted Corva watching him with a grin, her eyes wide. She was laughing, blood dripping down her arm from a fresh wound. Viserai rose a hand, snapping his arm out as he summoned another barrage of runechants. The air crackled with arcane energy as the clearing was filled with violet light, and he loosed every attack at once. Loud as a thunderclap, the air itself seemed to snap, flashes of light almost blinding him as he dashed toward the creatures. Viserai swung, decapitating one of the creatures, slicing at another, driving the sword through the open wound. The circle of runes at Corva\u2019s feet burst open as bodies climbed up out of the soil, little more than skeletons with scraps of decomposing flesh. They dragged themselves out of their shallow graves, empty sockets lighting with an unnatural energy as Corva charged them with an unnatural energy. Dispatching the last of Corva\u2019s strange creatures, he advanced on the skeletons, summoning another barrage of runechants. Lifting his blade, he began to cut a path through the endless stream of undead, gaze fixed on the woman standing just beyond. Her face was pale and waxy with blood loss, her wide eyes bright with laughter as she raised more and more of the fiends. Slowly, he waded through, growing closer and closer. His vision tunneled, focusing on Corva\u2019s face, instinct kicking in as he fought his way past her makeshift army. Yet the closer he got, the more she seemed to laugh, a wild look in her eyes as she egged him on, the runic circle growing brighter with every passing second. As he drew close, Viserai summoned one final runechant, lighting the space with a bright flare of aether. Some of the skeletons he felled began to clutch at his legs, weighing him down as he advanced. With a cry of pure rage, Corva wove a spell in mid-air, sending her own attack at him. It struck his armour, dispersing to the sides as Viserai swung his sword overhead. The blade sliced through her midsection, silversteel strengthened by the flow of aether, a wet plop sounding in the still night air as her internal organs slid out onto the ground below. With a choking sound, Corva looked up at Viserai and laughed. Even as she clutched at her stomach, several more fiends climbed out of the earth, meeting a swift end at the end of Viserai\u2019s blade. He watched impassively as the woman finally began to give into her wounds, taking the tome from her side and peeling her fingers away from its cover. \u201c\u2018s just a pet. Nothing without your master,\u201d Corva hissed at him, sinking to her knees. The runic circle flared as she called on the arcane, one hand outstretched. The skeletons around her instantly collapsed to the ground in a pile of bones. As the skin of her abdomen slowly began to knit back together, Viserai drove his blade through her chest, twisting the sword. With a quiet gurgle, Corva froze, blood trickling from the corners of her mouth. Pulling the sword from her ribcage, he let her corpse collapse silently to the ground. As he turned to walk away, he saw one of her creatures out of the corner of his eye and, strangely, hesitated. ...kept on a tight leash\u2026 After a moment, Viserai looked down at the tome in his hands. Its cover was deceptively plain, marked with bloodstains and what looked like the oily grease of bone marrow. Slowly, he opened the front cover and began to flick through the pages. There were notes about several of Corva\u2019s rituals, including the one that she\u2019d performed earlier, but it was only once he reached the messier sections of the book that the true subject of her research became clear. Scribbled across the page, covered in notes and additions, were Corva\u2019s notes on the subject of control. Control over the undead was a basic necessity for one of her kind; being able to command those that they brought back. However, Corva had been studying whether the same rituals and spells could be applied to a living person. No amount of power shall ever be enough to satisfy his desires\u2026 a tool to be used, kept on a tight leash\u2026 \u2026 a tight leash\u2026 A faint laugh rang through the air. Viserai turned, looking at his surroundings. Amongst the corpses of Corva\u2019s creatures lay a small, inanimate figure. Pale and delicate, it was almost the size of a vidus, dressed in white and gold robe with a ruffled collar. It bore a wide grin, stretching from ear to ear, revealing a set of dagger-sharp teeth. Its large golden eyes gleamed in the moonlight, pupils narrowed to tiny slits. A pair of small horns sprouted from its harline, almost the same colour as its golden hair. Its skin was smooth as polished wood and white as porcelain, its dainty hands tipped with razor-like claws. Arknight. A voice rung inside of his skull, not unlike Whisper\u2019s; yet where Whisper\u2019s voice had been soft and soothing, this was sweet, honeyed, laced with a dark undertow. Do you want to spend the rest of your days serving your master? Images flashed through his mind; chains around bloodied limbs, a man screaming as a crystal was embedded into his chest, runic script carved into skin with a scalpel. His armour lying upon a table, coated in blood. Viserai, wizened, drained, his skin grey, runes covering the entirety of his face. Chains wound around his throat, choking him, his skin turning black beneath the metal.   Viserai, washing up on a beach, the slow turn of a gargoyle\u2019s head as it watched Sutcliffe come across him. The master, dragging his body into the laboratory. A younger Lord Sutcliffe, slashing open his palm, allowing the blood to spill into a stone circle. Another man, much older, swearing himself to the Demonastery; a woman carving a runic sigil into her wrist; Corva, watching as a pallas flew down and gripped her severed finger in its claws, flying off into the mists. Blinking away the dark spots in his vision, Viserai looked down to the tome in his hands. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d His voice grated, raspy from disuse, forcing the words out past his damaged vocal cords. Everything. More images, this time of the Scriptorium, tomes lined along its shelves; residents of the Demonastery, seen from a distance, a third party watching them work; the creature Viserai hunted, roaming the hallways. Viserai tilted his head, considering. \u201cWhy?\u201d Power... A man, standing in a clearing, clutching a tome to his chest. The same man, younger, listening to someone speak of order, laws. Golden chains around his wrists, wrapping tighter and tighter. \u2026insurrection. Viserai looked down at his sword, shining with the bright glow of aether. After a long moment, he knelt, driving his blade into the ground. The moment that the blade struck, he suddenly felt a blinding pain within his skull, striking like a clap of thunder. Falling to his knees, Viserai\u2019s vision began to darken, and as he stared ahead, slowly fading, he could have sworn he saw the little figure laugh.   It was dark, a pitch black that blocked out even the slightest fragment of light. Viserai slowly rolled to one side, pushing away the lingering sensation of pain echoing within his head. His muscles felt stiff and sore, his body slow to respond as he began to sit up. Reaching up, he prodded at his face with the tips of his fingers, realising that his helm was missing. As he tried to stand, the lights around him flared to life, casting the room in shades of blue and white. Without his helm, the light was almost blinding. Viserai shaded his eyes with one hand, squinting as he took in his surroundings. Slowly, Viserai looked at the room around him, recognising the statues and windows of the entrance hall. The hall was crowded with motionless figures, dark shapes against the blinding lights. Trying to focus past the pain, Viserai stepped closer, gazing at the shapes nearest to him. The Demonastery was home to all kinds of researchers, scientists and arcane practitioners, none of whom had any attachment to morals or limitations. It was inevitable that some of their experiments would go wrong, and Viserai knew of some of the failed experiments and mutated abominations that stalked the Demonastery\u2019s halls. However, the sheer number of creatures packed into the hall was surprising, even to him. Some were clearly shaped by alchemy, others bearing moving mechanical parts, some large, some small, some translucent and shapeless, others solid and unchanging. They only had two things in common: for one, all of them were in the Demonastery. The second was that every last creature present looked incredibly dangerous. Viserai noted his helm lying nearby and picked it up, putting it back on. Now that he looked, he realised that there were weapons lying at the edges of the room, and some of the larger, more humanoid creatures were wearing makeshift armour. Beware the man born into power, who abandoned his people to pursue the Arcane Arts. He who, even now, seeks power to rival the Aesir themselves. He who would bend and break the laws of this world as he sees fit. No amount of power shall ever be enough to satisfy his desires. The words sounded through his mind, though not with the echo of a memory. Viserai turned, noting the gleam of blue and violet glass. Making his way over to Whisper, he came to a halt just in front of the window, frowning. \u201cI listened to your warning. Lord Sutcliffe is no longer my master.\u201d You did not listen. Look upon the army of one who thinks himself a god. Viserai looked over the creatures behind him, all immobilised by some unseen force. In the background, the statue loomed over them all, his outstretched hands casting shadows over the gathered creatures. A soft laugh echoed through the room, tinged with the unmistakable bite of mockery. Prepare yourself, Arknight. All will become clear soon enough.",

        "Across the rolling hills of Volcor, the earth was stained black with soot and ash, lava rivers a smear of colour against the dark landscape. Villages lay tucked between the rocky slopes, ruled by generals, their fate determined by the ebb and flow of battle. Step into any one of Volcor\u2019s villages and you\u2019ll find a hardy people, determined and headstrong, forged by the inhospitable environment they call home. Beyond them, the silhouette of Mt. Volcor rises above the rocky slopes, a massive active volcano which can be seen from the furthest borders of the region. A plume of toxic smoke and poisonous gases rises into the air, painting the sky in shades of grey and blocking out the sun for months at a time.   A path cut into the slope of the volcano leads to the imperial palace, an imposing structure carved from obsidian and stone. The palace extends deep below the earth, a massive network of underground halls providing a home for every member of the royal court. It stands apart from the villages far below, equal parts magnificent and formidable, separated from the rest of Volcor by a series of stone walls and grand gates. Within the palace walls, the hallways were bustling as servants began to prepare for the evening meal, young wizards making their way to and from various training exercises. Lengths of scarlet fabric hung from the ceiling, adding a vibrant splash of colour to the stone halls, carved from the volcanic rock found throughout Volcor. The golden-pink of rhyolite was streaked through the dark stone, revealed through cracks and fissures in the rock. In some places, the rock had been chiseled away to reveal pockets of pure rhyolite, providing a clear space for a sigil to be inscribed into the soft pink stone. Great golden lanterns illuminated the halls, casting everything they touched in a soft, warm glow. Crystals formed from molten magma radiated the warmth of the midday sun, chasing away the chill of the shadows. Soft woven mats lay underfoot, a sharp contrast to the unyielding stone beneath. Doorways were marked with finely painted screens, depicting scenes of Volcor\u2019s history, the Emperors that came before, and the legendary dragon that gave life to the fires of Volcor. A court wizard strolled down one such hallway, his crimson robes a splash of colour against the pale mats and dark stone walls. The crimson fabric was bordered in fine gold embroidery, set against the jet-black skirt of his robes. In one hand, he held a staff carved from pure obsidian, gold detailing running along its length. His hair was drawn up into a high ponytail, decorated with a large, blood-red feather plume, which was held in place by an intricate golden hairpin.   As he strode down the hall, Kano came to a stop near one of the sigils embedded in the wall, weaving a spell into the air with his free hand. Most of the court\u2019s wizards weren\u2019t required to perform such menial tasks, but most wizards had already received a title and become a true member of the royal court. Kano, still awaiting a title, was still included within the group of young wizards that worked to maintain the spells around the palace. When he checked, the sigil was in the first stages of unravelling, showing faint signs of aetheric disturbance. Sighing, he began the process of casting the sigil once more, knitting together the wisps of aether. While tedious, repairing sigils wasn\u2019t the worst of Kano\u2019s menial tasks - that dubious honour belonged to the water seals. To someone with the blood of the dragon running through his veins, performing water magic felt inherently wrong, like having your body flipped inside out. As he approached one of the seals that maintained the palace\u2019s water system, he shuddered involuntarily, expression morphing into one of distaste. Drawing on the aether around him, Kano tapped into the magic of the arcane seal, grimacing as the impression of cool, running water washed over him. Reweaving the seal as quickly as possible, he bound the spell with a shiver. Just as he released the flow of aether, Kano heard a large, shuddering boom echo down the hall, the very air around him vibrating with a release of arcane energy. The door to one of the training rooms burst open, as one of the young wizards collapsed through the doorway, screaming in agony. Flames raced up the side of his robes, covering his writhing body in a blanket of fire. Another wizard immediately followed him, lowering herself to the ground at his side. Minako\u2019s face was set with determination, teeth grit tightly as she quickly worked to draw the fire away from her student. Kano could feel the pull from across the room, as the fire clung to the young wizard\u2019s body, refusing to budge. Minako gave one last tug, and the fire flew into her waiting hands. With a flourish, she stifled it between her palms, skin untouched by the heat of the flames. Next to her, the apprentice gave a strangled groan. In spite of her best efforts, the fire had burned through parts of his clothing, leaving the skin beneath a bright, searing red. Even at this distance, Kano could see that the edges of his burns were already beginning to peel. Two of the servants walking nearby immediately ran over, already hurrying to obey Minako\u2019s rapid-fire orders. As he watched, several more students emerged from the room, rushing to help their mentor. \u201cThird one this week.\u201d Kano turned to find the Lord Wizard Akihiko standing next to him, his expression unreadable. \u201cThis is the second from among Minako\u2019s students.\u201d \u201cThis has happened twice already?\u201d Akihiko nodded, jaw clenched. \u201cI don\u2019t recall anything like that happening in our class.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been more frequent, recently.\u201d As one of the servants rushed past them, a large bowl of water clutched close to her chest, the Lord Wizard turned to look at Kano with a sigh. \u201cWalk with me.\u201d As they walked, Kano occasionally stopped to check another of the sigils, repairing and reweaving the spell with a wave of his hand. For the most part, the Lord Wizard Akihiko remained unusually silent. \u201cSo, Kano. How did you pass the Trial of Embers, again?\u201d Kano shook his head, chuckling at the familiar subject. \u201cI told you, Lord Wizard Akihiko, it was just a stroke of good luck. A happy accident. A moment of genius. I couldn\u2019t possibly explain it.\u201d The Lord Wizard merely sighed in response, his expression strained. Expecting some kind of quip in return, Kano waited, surprised when nothing else followed. The Lord Wizard Akihiko remained quiet, allowing the silence to stretch between them. After a long moment, Kano cleared his throat. \u201cWell, I guess it has been ten years now.\u201d The Lord Wizard\u2019s head swivelled toward him, an eyebrow raised in question. \u201cIt was an incantation I found in an old tome, to strengthen a person\u2019s connection to the arcane.\u201d The Lord Wizard\u2019s expression went completely blank, his gaze appearing to stare straight through Kano, rather than looking at him. \u201cYou used an incantation to modify your connection to the arcane?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d The Lord Wizard shook his head, muttering to himself. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense. The wards should have prevented\u2026 What kind of an incantation was this?\u201d \u201cAetheric.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not possible,\u201d he hissed, mouth curling into the beginnings of a snarl. Then, abruptly, the Lord Wizard paused. \u201cYou gave the same incantation to the other students, didn\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cYes. It didn\u2019t work as well for them, though.\u201d Kano watched as the Lord Wizard\u2019s face almost seemed to clear, mouth curling into a crooked smile, a chuckle escaping him. \u201cHow very interesting.\u201d With another laugh, he continued strolling forward, seemingly oblivious to Kano\u2019s look of confusion. \u201cDo you often use aether spells and incantations?\u201d \u201cYes... I enjoy casting fire, but using aether in spellwork is more interesting. I found some spells in an old tome, so I started teaching myself how to cast them, and then learned how to magnify my fire magic with aether spells.\u201d \u201cWas it difficult?\u201d \u201cAt first, yes.\u201d Kano hesitated, gesturing vaguely in the direction they\u2019d come from, to the student who had collapsed to the ground in flames. \u201cI haven\u2019t told anyone this, but I\u2019ve noticed something happening to the aether, recently. It feels wrong, somehow. Warped. I don\u2019t know how to explain it; I just can\u2019t shake this feeling that something big is going to happen.\u201d That strange smile was still tugging at the Lord Wizard\u2019s lips, transforming what may have been intended as an encouraging nod into something vaguely menacing. \u201cI understand, Kano. I\u2019ve been getting that same exact feeling, recently.\u201d The Lord Wizard paused, staring into the middle-distance. \u201cWe should go speak to the Chamber of the Dragon. They should hear this.\u201d Without waiting to hear Kano\u2019s reply, the Lord Wizard Akihiko began walking down the hallway, pausing only for long enough to check that Kano was following. The Lord Wizard led him down several levels, descending into the innermost levels of the palace. As one of the younger members of the court, and titleless at that, Kano had never had the opportunity to explore this area of the palace. The innermost sector was reserved primarily for the immediate family of the Emperor, and ministers from among the Chamber of the Dragon. As they descended, the carved stone walls gave way to gilded panels, great crystals mounted just behind, enchanted so that their fiery light moved like free-flowing magma. The panels cast a warm glow through the halls, illuminating the finely-woven mats that lay underfoot. They descended further still, and Kano took note of the silence that surrounded them as they moved further and further away from the palace\u2019s other inhabitants. Kano followed Akihiko, mouth pulled into a small frown. The more that he thought about it, the more strange all of this seemed. While he\u2019d never stepped foot inside this part of the palace, he had assumed it would be busy; filled with servants rushing to obey their masters, and ministers and lord wizards making their way to and from various engagements. Yet ever since he stepped foot in this part of the palace, he hadn\u2019t seen so much as a simple servant. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise the chamber\u2019s halls were this deep,\u201d Kano remarked casually. The Lord Wizard stayed silent, his face hidden from view as the man walked two steps ahead of him. Kano quickened his pace slightly, turning his head to look at Akihiko\u2019s expression. His former mentor was completely unreadable, his grey eyes cold as steel. Kano frowned, noticing the stir of aether in the air, the telltale sign of a wizard preparing to cast a spell. His gaze flicked down to see a ripple of energy over the palms of Akihiko\u2019s hands, like the heat waves that rippled above Volcor\u2019s pools of molten magma. With a flick of the wrist, Kano caught the fireball thrown at him, allowing the heat to dissipate into the air. He caught the following wave of fire in the palms of his hands, allowing it to spin around him before whipping it back at the Lord Wizard. As he sidestepped another fireball, Kano began to draw on the aether around him, hands weaving a spell into being. The arcane energy began to build, and as Kano ducked to one side, he slashed a hand through the air, sending the burgeoning spell flying at Lord Wizard Akihiko. It connected with his energy, visibly dissipating as it smothered the Lord Wizard\u2019s arcane connection. Akihiko immediately froze, going completely still. Wide eyes stared back at Kano, his pupils constricted, the whites of his eyes showing around the iris. Startled, Kano took a step back, one hand forming an arcane barrier in front of him - and then very abruptly stopped. Even as he watched, the Lord Wizard\u2019s skin was taking on a grey pallor, irises and pupils fading to milky-white, branches of violet-green veins showing through his pale skin. Slowly, Akihiko\u2019s lips drew back into a snarl, teeth bared, his hands curling into fists. The sound that he released was inhuman, an ear-splitting shriek that echoed down the length of the hall. Without warning, the man leapt at him, hands outstretched, clawing at Kano like a rabid animal. Reflexively, he tossed a fireball at his former mentor, who failed to dodge the flames heading straight toward him. The fireball immediately collided head-on. With another shrill, deafening shriek, the Lord Wizard collapsed to the ground, writhing in agony. Just as Kano stepped forward, unsure, smoke began to pour from the man\u2019s ears and nose, plumes of black smoke that flooded the hall with the smell of sulfur. Even as Kano drew the fire away, holding it at the ready, Akihiko continued to writhe on the floor, now eerily silent. With one final shudder, the Lord Wizard Akihiko went still, the last of the smoke escaping from his nostrils. After a long moment, Kano allowed the fire to extinguish, cautiously approaching the still form of his former mentor. Now that he lay still, Kano could suddenly see the Lord Wizard\u2019s sunken cheeks, the bluish pallor to his skin, the dark rings that circled his eyes. The skin on his hands was wrinkled and dry, his lips cracked, unseeing milky-white eyes staring blankly into the middle distance.   The sound of thunderous footsteps startled Kano out of his confusion, whipping around in time to see a host of armored imperial guards racing around the corner. As they came into view, Kano recognised the Lord Wizard at the front of the group, her alarmed gaze meeting his. As he watched, the Lord Wizard Chiyo\u2019s gaze fell to the body at his feet, shock rippling across her expression at the sight of Akihiko\u2019s corpse. Well, shit. \u201cThis isn\u2019t what it looks like.\u201d The Lord Wizard Chiyo looked back up at Kano, jaw set, her expression shifting into one of horror. \u201cTake him to the Chamber of the Dragon.\u201d",

        "However, any gateway to the eternal realm is innately unstable. \u00edArathael is, by its very nature, in a state of constant transformation, and no two people who walk through the gateway will arrive in the same place.

        "(Written by Nicola Price, edited by Tarryn Thomas, illustrated by Nikolay Moskvin.)  A heavy silence blanketed the great hall, which was saturated with the metallic stench of blood and bile. The once pristine walls were streaked with copper stains, and claret pooled beneath cooling corpses, their expressions twisted with fear and pain. Only one of the room\u2019s occupants remained upright, stalking through the carnage. For the first time she could remember, the Barthimont estate lay completely silent, deprived of even the tangible, unspoken tension which usually hung in the air. Yet, as Levia drew nearer to the main entrance of the great hall, she heard the faint, distant sound of footsteps echoing down the hallway lying just beyond the doors. A slight, pale man rounded the corner, his gaunt face a study in sharp angles and leaden skies. As his steely-grey eyes met Levia\u2019s gaze, his expression turned dour, lips twisting into a grimace. You.\u201d The stranger sighed, tone dripping with distaste. \u201cI had plans for her, but you\u2014this changes our strategy entirely. No matter; far too late to change that now. You are powerful, in your own way\u2026 Perhaps we might use you, instead.\u201d He extended one hand towards her, something clasped within his palm, foolishly ignoring the rage which rippled across Levia\u2019s countenance. When her gaze settled on his outstretched hand, something burned at the corners of her vision, the singe of shadow aether a familiar assault on her senses. Here was the same power, the same dark influence that she\u2019d come to know so well. Levia could almost hear the Lady\u2019s laughter, could almost taste the black blood on the back of her tongue. \u201cCome with me,\u201d the man continued, dark gaze falling to Levia\u2019s curled talons. \u201cI can offer you power, make you even stronger. The power you laid claim to today is but a fraction of\u2014\u201d Snarling, Levia lunged towards the strange visitor, slamming him against the nearest wall. Her clawed fingers cut easily into his flesh, shreds of fabric hanging from his battered skin as Levia drove her hand into his chest, elbow-deep in the man\u2019s ribcage. She felt the staccato rhythm beat against her palm, his muscles seizing as blood vessels burst beneath her pointed talons, and then she tore the stranger\u2019s heart from his chest.   With a wet, disbelieving gurgle, he collapsed to the ground, face going slack as his blood pooled atop the marble. Levia crushed his heart in her fist, letting the shredded tissue spill onto the floor at her feet. The skin on his chest tore easily beneath her talons, exposing his internal organs to her ravenous gaze. Sinking her hands into the pooling blood, she grabbed his organs by the handful, ramming lungs and kidneys and intestines into her open mouth, grinding the viscera between her teeth until they were a fine paste, watery purge leaking from her carnassials. As the bloodlust faded, hunger sated for the time being, her gaze fell to the glimmer of burnished metal, silver brushed clean by the touch of hundreds of hands. Her bloodied fingers pried the unfamiliar pendant from his grasp, which remained unyielding even in death. A small, grotesque gargoyle met her gaze, the claws on its hands forming a rudimentary clasp at the top of the pendant. As she gazed down at the object, she felt the telltale etchings of an inscription on the back, rough against her fingertips. When Levia turned the pendant over, she found an unfamiliar script carved into the silver surface.   Some say that those who die come to this:That which brings both an endAnd a new beginning.For this simple bribe,An invitation awaits thee.   Another gargoyle, carved of stone, sat before her. Its expression was one of mischief, its cold, unyielding features curled into something almost resembling a smirk. As the pendant came into contact with its outstretched palm, the wall behind it began to shudder and shake, solid stone crumbling before her eyes, revealing a sliver of darkness amidst the blazing light of the rising sun. In an instant, the pendant simply disappeared, leaving only a tiny plume of white smoke. Levia inspected the opening with a small frown and, with one last glance at her surroundings, stepped through the revealed archway. The grounds of the Demonastery stretched out before her, the earth concealed beneath a thick layer of fog. In the middle-distance, a great, wrought-iron gate stretched toward the sky, formed from the crossed blades of two large, grand winged statues, locked in eternal combat. As she passed beneath the shadow of the two warring beings, Levia felt the curl of raw aether in the air; she could almost taste the sweet, cloying energies of ancient spellwork on the back of her tongue. To the left of the gate lay a small guardhouse, abandoned, and some deep, unspoken instinct at the back of her mind shuddered at the sight of the decrepit shack. Turning her gaze away, Levia refocused her attention on the courtyard proper, watching as the mist crept away from her, revealing intricate runework on the river stones. Some of the runes were small, decorating the flagstones with simpler spells, while some were significantly more powerful, bordering the entire courtyard in layers upon layers of intricate spellwork. After a long moment, the Demonastery itself came into view. A large, imposing gothic manor, it stretched far to the east and to the west; stained glass windows lined its walls, hanging below stone arches and towering spires. The massive front door was cracked open, and dusky light spilled out onto the flagstones. As Levia drew nearer, something within her shuddered at the perfect silence, absent the usual distant calls and eerie shrieks which were wont to echo across the grounds.   ...the usual? How would I know what it\u2019s usually like? In spite of herself, Levia\u2019s feet carried her away from the open doorway, instinctually wary of the obvious invitation. The still air brought a chill to her veins, silence weighing upon her shoulders like the calm before a storm. Instead, Levia turned her gaze away from the entrance, and chose instead to follow the outline of the building. As she stalked through the grounds, Levia found a part of her awakening, rising to the surface, as if attempting to rouse itself from a dream. A darkness seeped into the corners of her vision, the world turning dim, the taste of blood rising on the back of her tongue. Detached, Levia found herself moving a little faster. The now-familiar feeling of hunger crawled up her throat, leaving her with a desperation which blanketed her senses, overwhelming her mind with the craving for flesh. Seizing back her train of thought, Levia forced herself to focus on the faint, burning pain which radiated from her closed fists, her curled talons slicing into the palms of her hands. As her breath slowed, the bloodlust slowly began to fade, allowing her to see her surroundings once more. A sea of green and glass stretched out before her, and a name rose to the tip of her tongue, unbidden; a foreign whisper which allowed her to glimpse the verdant, wild greenery which once had filled this room. The Venarium.   The name rose to the tip of her tongue, unbidden, as if whispered by some long-forgotten echo at the edges of her consciousness. For one split-second, Levia could have sworn she remembered the Venarium in all its former glory. The once-thriving plants were mottled with blight, an ink-dark sludge seeping down their stems; their leaves were stained a murky grey. In spite of the gloom of her surroundings, the air was heavy with the ironrot stench of black blood and the sickly-sweet stench of decay. Catching a faint movement out of the corner of her eye, Levia turned her gaze toward the nearest plant. Its leaves had split open to reveal tooth-like growths, stained a deep, congealing crimson. It looked as though it was rotting from the inside out, its torn, green flesh revealing a putrescent liquid, half-digested innards spilling out onto the soil which covered its roots. As she neared it, her gaze drawn to the mutated life form, something deep within her chest reacted to its presence; a deep hunger which needled through her body. It called to her, like to like, a magnetic pull that drew her closer. The plant bloomed across her face, climbing along her jawline like ivy. The moment it made contact, she could feel its tiny roots trying to burrow beneath the surface of her skin, clinging tightly to the outermost layer of her flesh. Where it touched her it burned, igniting a molten heat which raced along the outline of the plant\u2019s razor-like grip, a searing pain trickling down her throat and setting it aflame, as if something were trying to burn her from the inside out. Levia\u2019s vision tinted red, the rest of the world falling away as her focus narrowed to a razor\u2019s edge. The hunger blocked out everything else. A shrill howl escaped her throat as she lashed out, slashing at the vines with her talons, her eyes flashing with rage as she fought to gain the upper hand. A caustic scent flooded the air as the plant released its toxins, and she felt it burning all the way into the pit of her stomach. Sinking her claws into its fleshy stem, Levia tore it away from her face, pulling its vines from her throat before they could reach her lungs. With a guttural snarl, she shredded the plant between her talons and ground the remnants beneath her heel, savouring the feeling of the mutated flesh bursting underfoot. At last the Venarium was silent once more, broken only by Levia\u2019s heaving breaths. As she backed away from the rest of the corrupted plants, she turned her attention to the nearest wall of the manor, only then noticing the tantalisingly familiar scent which drifted through a crack in the facade. As if of their own volition, her feet carried her forward, heading towards the source. When she lowered her head, Levia could only just glimpse the interior of a room through the thin gap. Levia\u2019s bones began to crackle and snap as her skin writhed, and after a long moment, she managed to get a handle on her newfound power. Her body collapsed beneath her, ribs and vertebrae popping and shifting, her entire skeleton dismantling itself, bone by painstaking bone. As her skull finally fell to the stone floor, her body was finally liquefied, transforming into a tarry, amorphous pile of blackened viscera. It wobbled only slightly as it began to climb the surface of the wall, squeezing through the crack in the stones. With a series of sickening cracks, her body slowly reformed inside the mansion, and Levia found herself standing in the midst of a large, sparsely-decorated room. Glimpses of the room\u2019s former appearance were visible beneath layers of organic, crimson biological matter. The walls were coated in a slimy, visceral texture not unlike wet muscle, pulsating in the low light. There was something so distinctly unnatural about the sight that an instinctive revulsion brought bile to the back of her throat, her veins burning with the need to fight or flee. Drawing air into her lungs with a sharp hiss, she turned her attention to the hallway just beyond, catching the faintest movements within the depths of the shadows. The thing staggered forward in an unsteady, lopsided gait, lurching to one side with each faltering step. In the low light of the lanterns, parts of its body looked almost human, with hints of unmarred flesh: a knee here, a finger there, part of an ordinary chest, ribs curving just above its stomach. However, at the edges of its body, changes rippled across its skin, revealing great networks of mottled veins and sharp talons. One good eye stared out of a broken face, a cheekbone sliced in two by a mouthful of needle-like teeth. Its other eye bulged out of a sunken socket, breaking away into dozens of glittering white pustules. The jutting edges of its mandible curved around the base of its skull, a gruesome imitation of a halo, carved from tarnished bone. As the creature drew closer, Levia looked upon the near-human parts of its face and felt the icy, distant disquiet of familiarity; a name on the tip of her tongue. Another pair of the fiends crept out into the hallway, appearing amidst the gloom. When the first creature drew within range, Levia threw herself upon it with a snarl, claws tearing through its flesh as a ship\u2019s prow would slice through the water. In spite of its malevolent appearance, it bled like any other creature, its ichor red as any human\u2019s would be. It crumpled to the marble floor with a dull crunch, and in the following heartbeat, the second creature lunged for her throat, only to meet a similar fate. With a dull thud, its body collapsed, leaving the one remaining beast in Levia\u2019s path. It stared at her blankly over the corpses for one long moment before it turned on its heel and fled down the hall. Its hesitant, blundering gait was all too reminiscent of a wounded animal, desperate in its attempts to escape the predator which followed in its wake. Something about its features stirred Levia\u2019s bloodlust to a fever pitch, the familiar sensation of searing hunger seeping through her veins. It inevitably stained her sight a deep, dark scarlet, blotting out her peripheral vision in a haze of bloodied mist. Levia remained oblivious to the difference; driven by hunger, her gaze was fixed on the creature, which raced just out of reach. Just as her fingertips brushed its expanse of waxy flesh, it burst through an open doorway, dodging her outstretched talons. The room opened up before her to reveal a veritable horde of the beasts, all bearing the same bleary, steely flintlock eyes. Levia tried not to stare at their facial features, the distant echoes of familiarity discordant inside her skull, the faint ringing in her ears only growing louder and more shrill when she looked at them for too long. Some of the fiends could almost have been entirely human, if not for the distinct slimy coating on their skin. Grainy with ocean-salt, it was as if they had risen from the depths of Death\u2019s Knell itself. Some looked like creatures from a half-remembered nightmare, only partly formed, their disjointed body parts strung together in the wrong order. The largest among them was a massive amorphous being whose ivory, gelatinous flesh glistened in the low light. A number of tentacle-like appendages sprouted from its pale form, holding aloft a single, disembodied head. Gleaming white bone lay exposed on one side of the head, the face split by a gash stretching from the top of the browbone to the corner of the mouth, lined with scarlet muscle and ivory sinew. The open wound revealed the edges of his reddened eyeball, his pupil dilated from the pain. And yet, as much as the creature fought to tear his face apart, the flesh continued to reform beneath the touch of its tentacles, as if stuck in an endless cycle of regrowth. The man\u2019s wide, pale green eyes locked onto Levia\u2019s from across the room, his teeth bared in an expression raw with both anger and agony. Without warning, an unfamiliar voice echoed within her mind, a tangible feeling which translated itself readily into words.   Free me. If you wish to avoid meeting the same fate as I have, free me, and I shall share what I know. In that same moment, the beast turned its gaze towards Levia, its face contorting with an expression she recognised as bloodlust. Free me now. After a split-second\u2019s hesitation, Levia hissed under her breath, surging toward the colossal beast which now reached for her, tearing through its appendages and loosening its grip just long enough to rip the head from its grasp. Tucking it beneath her arm, she turned and lunged for the open doorway, a deep rumble shaking the floorboards beneath her feet as the beast roared. She could feel the vibrations underfoot as it rose, clawing its way down the hall, hot on her heels in pursuit. Even as the head\u2019s disembodied thoughts directed her through the labyrinthine network of hallways, Levia\u2019s feet were guided by pure instinct, chasing her far away from the gargantuan creature which threatened to consume them both. Bursting into the entrance hall, her gaze landed on a doorway at the opposite end, a pool of writhing shadows which flickered ominously just beyond the threshold. Levia distantly heard the protests of the disembodied voice, the head calling on her to turn around, but with the beast surging behind them, she ignored it. Pushing herself to run harder, move faster, she made for the doorway, aware of the ground quaking beneath her feet. She felt the moment the beast blasted through the stone archway, heard the distant crackle of its amorphous mass reshaping, and the burst of air as its tentacles streaked through the air, aimed directly at her disappearing figure. In the split-second before it wrapped her in its grasp, she leapt through the gateway, tumbling through to the other side.   A visceral, crimson landscape stretched as far as her eyes could see. Levia\u2019s feet came into contact with layers upon layers of rotting carrion, her gaze greeted by writhing fiends and decomposing corpses.  Blasmophet\u2019s domain was a sea of gluttonous waste; consumption incarnate, a hunger for power only sated by devouring the bodies of friend and foe alike. Yet when she turned her attention to the head hanging from her fingers, its teeth were bared in a snarl. This is the worst place you could have run to. Do you have any idea where you\u2019ve just taken us? Levia\u2019s gaze fell upon the contours of the crimson hellscape, a path of blood and bone curving into the distance. Something unfamiliar swelled within her chest, sharp and grating, stealing the breath from her lungs. It took her a long moment to recognise the bubble of panic which threatened to overwhelm her, her limbs turning cold and unresponsive as stone. What is this? The surrounding landscape seemed distant, her own body foreign territory; Levia had been set adrift from herself, overwhelmed by a great, unmoving wall of fear. \u201cThis is not mine,\u201d she hissed, feeling her lips curl with distaste. She had learned to abandon her fear long ago, an emotion now so alien to her that she had almost assumed it to be some kind of malevolent influence. Against her will, she found her eyes drawn to horizon, where unfamiliar beasts gathered around fresh carrion. Are you listening? That same fire which had blazed within her just days before, the very same that had driven her to behead Lady Barthimont, now awakened in the pit of her stomach, determination steeling her nerves. \u201cI bow to none.\u201d The head swung wildly at her hip, his distant voice hissing distaste, as Levia turned towards the horizon, set her sights on the beasts which gathered there, and struck. The first of Blasmophet\u2019s creatures were small, wyrm-like beasts, having barely sprouted legs and teeth. Like crustaceans, they scuttled along the earth, yet they were half the height of a grown man and still posed a threat to the unaware. Levia pulled apart their gelatinous forms with her bare hands, ripping through their bodies, and snapping their spindly limbs. The second class of Blasmophet\u2019s creatures was larger: some bipedal, some on four limbs, others moving along the earth on a series of insect-like legs. Whether they bared teeth or barbed tongues, Levia tore each one apart, cramming their flesh into her mouth and devouring them piece by bloody piece. The third class of Blasmophet\u2019s creatures took was well-mutated, picking up several traits from their prey. Multiple heads, mouths filled with razor-like teeth; great, writhing beasts whose faces were a mass of feelers, ripping their prey apart by their limbs. Levia cut each one down, finding their weaknesses and striking them into the earth, to feed her unending hunger. The fourth of Blasmophet\u2019s creatures was an abomination, with great, bulbous bodies, multitudes of limbs armed with prodigious claws, sprouting extra bodies from their backs or sporting layers of toxic flesh. Their mouths were lined with hundreds of teeth, ready to devour their prey; they were killing machines fuelled by the need to consume. Levia attacked them mercilessly, using her speed and strength to her advantage, bludgeoning them and mutilating their limbs until they could no longer move, and she could bring them to their knees. Some attempted to consume her, but Levia persisted, tearing them apart from the inside out. The fifth and final class of Blasmophet\u2019s creatures were the beasts of old, colossal and unyielding\u2014yet Levia used their size against them, climbing their amorphous forms and ripping out great chunks of flesh, devouring them piece by piece, claiming their power one mouthful at a time. Yet still she hungered, consuming more and more until she finally had the strength she needed to face Blasmophet\u2019s Harbinger. Devoratum lingered at the centre of Blasphema, watching over the empty throne. Almost four times her height, the colossal fiend towered above her, its grey, fleshy body twisted and misshapen. Dozens of eyes sprouted from the top of its body, reddened and glistening in the light, their dilated pupils locked onto Levia. Multitudes of slender, frog-like limbs supported its immense weight, allowing it to scuttle along the earth like a centipede. A gash in the front of its body constituted a kind of mouth, opening to reveal a great, gaping chasm lined with hundreds of razor-sharp fangs, its dozens of tentacle-like tongues covered in a corrosive saliva.   However, even in the face of this horrendous brute, Levia did not falter. After hunting and devouring enough creatures to become a beast in her own right, Levia went toe to toe with the Devoratum, propelled by sheer rage and bloodlust, lunging at the being\u2019s immense mass of a body. Levia tore out one of its eyes with her bare hands, snapped limbs with the weight of her mace, buried her talons into a writhing tongue and ripped it from the beast\u2019s mouth; she left great gashes along the side of its body. The massive, six-headed mace she wielded was a grounding centrepoint in the midst of the ravenous bloodlust, gouging great crimson wounds into the beast\u2019s flesh. Piece by piece, blow for blow, Levia clawed out chunks of raw flesh and crammed them down her throat, gaining half a step for each mouthful, siphoning power with every bite. Finally, finally, it began to slow, yielding to Levia\u2019s sheer determination, her teeth bared as she ripped another one of the tongues from its mouth. It tried in vain to escape her grasp as she dealt the killing blow, and consumed the Devoratum in its entirety. The mass of gelatinous flesh disappeared past her lips, organs staining her chest as she devoured the beast, claiming its power for her own.   When Levia stepped back through the gateway, she could smell the difference in the air, could feel the quiet give of power as the balance shifted in her favour. Yet, as she stood there, she felt the slow swell of an oncoming storm, felt static flood her limbs, paralysed by some intangible force. Something came to the forefront of her mind, a presence not unlike the distant, detached voice of the disembodied head she still wore at her hip. Thank you for your assistance\u2026 I can take it from here. In an instant, Levia recognised the voice, felt the sharp sting of anger as she bared her teeth. You. I killed you. You should be dead. You should know better than that. People like you and I, we do not die so easily. His reverberating laughter stoked the tight burn of her rage into a firestorm, and distantly, Levia felt their\u2014felt her hand curl into a fist, talons biting into their palm sharply enough to draw blood. Now, surrender to me, and I might just let you remain.   This is my body, and you shall not control it. You think you can fight me for it? Again, she felt the caustic sting of his sardonic laughter. Try. Distantly, they both heard the scuttle of half-formed footsteps echoing throughout the room, as the waxy creatures emerged into the entrance hall. This time, Levia could recognise their features, and finally placed why the beasts had seemed so frustratingly familiar. You\u2026 What are they? What are you? My creations\u2014 our creations, I suppose. Though they will not recognise me in this form. Despite not being able to see his expressions, Levia could sense the wry amusement, could almost glimpse his irritating smirk. Give me control, or they will attack. No. Give me back my body. That\u2019s not how this works. Levia growled, overwhelmed with raw fury. The struggle for their/his/her body was indescribable, the sensation of wresting a parasite from deep within her chest, pulling the very air from her lungs with her own two hands. It burned, a caustic compulsion, like trying to breathe under the surface of a lake and only drawing in ever more silty water, drowning in mud and filth. She could almost get a grasp on his presence, could almost wrap her consciousness around his, but every time she came close he would writhe and slip out of her clutches, slinging his own thoughts back and poisoning her mind. As if through a great layer of fog, Levia heard the low, reverberating hum of the gateway behind them; felt the static energy in the air as something else emerged. Together, they moved their head just enough to glimpse the newcomers out of their peripheral vision, conjoined for one split-second by the need to sense what stood at their back. A man emerged ahead of the rest of his companions, black hair curling through the air like mist as he pulled through the surface of the veil. Faint runes blazed violet on the pale expanse of his skin, glowing beneath the straps of armor which covered part of his chest. His robe dissipated at the edges like a half-remembered dream, a chain whip slowly coiling, the segments reconnecting to form a sinister blade. His dark, severe gaze flicked to the creatures before them for a split-second before he turned his face to hers, expression unreadable. \u201cWhile your face is unfamiliar, I recognise the shadows under your skin. I see that Graves wishes to take control, but that coward lacks the power. Watch and learn.\u201d With a flick of his wrist, his sword separated once more, blades slicing through the air between them with a sharp crack. Like lightning, the very air seemed to spark and cleave itself in two, revealing a nebulous silhouette, framed by raw aether. The hunger made itself known, striking her with the force of thunder. She felt the exact moment that his control weakened, seized back the reins of her muscles, and with the speed and might of a gunshot, snapped the revealed soul between her teeth. Graves\u2019s consciousness was a fine wine on the surface of her tongue, slipping easily down her throat. Levia heard his voice fade with a deep sense of satisfaction, baring her teeth at the stranger in a rough approximation of a grin. He chuckled darkly, and for an instant, she glimpsed the presence which lingered in his shadow, eclipsed by the arcane aura which surrounded him. \u201cYou\u2019re like me.\u201d She laughed, the sound harsh, and felt the creatures behind her cower, slinking back into the shadows. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d \u201cYou can call me Chane. I found my patron beyond the veil, but it seems you found yours through\u2026 other means. Tell me\u2026\u201d \u201cLevia.\u201d \u201cLevia. Tell me, Levia, is your hunger satisfied by these pale imitations?\u201d He gestured to the creatures, lingering at the far end of the entrance hall, which only moments ago had been poised to strike. \u201cYour\u2026 Shadow. You both require a meal far more substantial than this, do you not?\u201d \u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d He grinned, gesturing to the other residents who now milled behind him, watching their interaction with thinly veiled interest. \u201cWe seek to strike at Solana\u2014the city would practically be a banquet for a power like yours. Even Sutcliffe desires to take a power like theirs.\u201d Chane gestured to the head at her hip, hands outstretched. \u201cJoin us, Levia, and devour the Light.\u201d",
        "(Art of Sam Yang) To the North of Korshem, far beyond Lake Frigid and the endless plains of ice and snow. Up the sides of mighty fjords that reach up into the heavens, lies a realm that floated amongst the long white clouds. This is Enion, the Armory of Ancients, and Training Ground of Champions. A place oft told in old wives' tales, or the singsong of the wandering bard, as the battlefield where Yvor, the mighty Ancient of Thunder and Ice, held back the legions of the Old Ones for ninety long cycles of the moon. 'Tis said that as Yvor fell, his blood imbued these shattered rocks with an incredible energy that set them adrift towards the heavens. His abandoned weapons became mighty vaults of iron and stone. And his pulsing veins, that held his energy and his essence, became the trails of the Aurora that danced through the skies of Enion, enveloping all that lie within in a soft and beautiful glow. And all manner of wonders and dangers lie hidden here, to this day, within these isles that hover high above the clouds. Lexi was born in Volthaven, a village that drifted slowly as it navigated the treacherous skies of Enion. Her childhood was spent in wide-eyed wonder, under the soft embrace of the Aurora, as she marveled at the majestic sights that lie beyond her windows. She loved the trails left by Yvor's mighty lightning, as they raced through the skies around Volthaven, and the silky road of glistening green that was sure to follow in its wake. She rejoiced at the first winter snow when it dusted her rooftop, and danced in the rain at the first sound of the thunder, which signaled the spring's return. She loved archery and sparring, and was quick on her feet! And from an early age she was captivated by stories of mighty Wayfarers that rode upon the Auroras to distant isles at the other ends of Rathe. One day, she vowed, she would be just like them! On the coldest of winters when the sky freezes over, and even Yvor's mighty thunder slowed to a sluggish crawl, the tales of Aria would fill the taverns of Volthaven as the entire village seemed to huddle around its massive hearth. These kind craftsman, seers, wayfarers and shamans were Lexi's mentors, her family, and they taught her of the world beyond their island. They spoke of the kindness of man, and their unspeakable evil. They spoke of the elements and their temperament, and the dangerous beasts hidden amongst the snowy mountaintops. They spoke of Yvor and its mighty lightning, and its enemies whose names had long been forgotten. The secrets of the Ancients, they said, lie deep in the heart of Enion. And should Lexi follow in the footsteps of the great Wayfarers, the elements will guide her wherever she needed to be. To be a Wayfarer of Volthaven, one must make peace with the essence of Lightning and Ice that permeated Enion. Now a young woman, Lexi ventured near and far with her mentors; the best, most skilled Wayfarers in all of Aria. She felt the constant coat of frost upon her hood, and arcs of static brushing upon her skin, and an incredible sense of freedom as she embraced the vastness in this land above the clouds. They would spend long days climbing up tree-tops and racing along cliffs, scaling massive mountains that would reveal yet another beautiful vista. They spent long cold nights tucked away within igloos of ice, gazing through crystalline sheets at the twinkles in the night sky overhead. Together they surveyed the ever-changing isles, marking safe passage for craftsman and foragers, and warding away any dangers. For it was their duty to guard the safe passage of Volthaven as it navigated this shimmering sea, and see to the needs of their people. And by and by, Lexi's powers grew, until she could channel the power of Lightning and Ice all on her own. At long last, she too could ride upon the trails of the Aurora like the most seasoned of Wayfarers, as all of Volthaven and Enion lay beneath her feet. With a flash of lightning behind her every springing step, Lexi ventured far from Volthaven. Her youth made her fearless, and her talents gave her strength. With practice and perseverance she became a master of the bow, and a most distinguished tracker, and her charm and stories earned her the love and respect of all but the most gruff of Elders. She was Volthaven's darling, the most daring of adventurers, and soon her fame rang out across the thousand isles of Enion. 'Twas like a dream, this peaceful life, but all dreams must come to an end. One night a mighty tremor shook all of Enion; it was as if Yvor had turned in its eternal sleep, and the entire world around Lexi trembled and shook. The Lightning that streaked through the sky turned violent, as they crashed into the isles with all their might. These isles that stood for eons began to crumble and break, as hanging gardens and clifftop forests froze and shattered under the mighty power of the elements. When the chaos subsided, Lexi gazed out into the land in shock and awe. While Volthaven remained largely intact, mighty gashes were carved into the isles around them, revealing hints of ancient, colossal structured buried within. The land around them began to hum a dull, low and ominous tone, as if Enion itself is about to awaken from a deep slumber. The elements around Lexi were agitated now, buzzing with an urgent desperation. They tugged upon her hair and stung her arms, as if urging her onwards towards the north. What is happening? The seers did not know. But it was clear that the answers they needed lay deep within the heart of Enion. With the Elders' blessing the Wayfarers set off once more into a familiar, yet alien land, with Lexi at their helm. This would be a dangerous journey, as the elements are thrown into disarray and their beloved aurora ebbed and faded. They resolved to follow the call of the elements, as they set off on their greatest adventure yet. This would be the chance to pierce the veil of Enion's hidden secrets, and unbeknownst to them, the start of a tale that may change the future of Rathe.",
        "Ever since, the Demonastery and Solana have stood in direct opposition to one another. It is the nature of the Shadow to destroy, seeking to eliminate the Light; the Light seeks to defend the innocent from the Shadows, and halt the spread of its vile corruption across the land of Rathe. Solana has fought many battles in its quest to bring an end to the scourge of the Shadow; however, for many years the city knew a kind of peace, untouched by the raging wars of their past.",
        "(Art of Sam Yang) Ash and smoke filled our lungs, as the stench of death weigh upon our every step. And the Old ones, drew ever near. We know not how this began, nor when. Time, fear, and the stench of death has smothered our senses, numbed our bodies, dulled our minds. All we knew was that we must not waver, for behind us lie our brethren and our broken dreams. Our home. We are the Ollin, defenders of humanity, the last line of defence against these rotten vermin that had infested our world. They are endless, we are few. But we are strong where they are weak, and our allies stretch from the skies to the seas; powerful Ancients that rose from the forest and the plains, mighty Titans born from the land beneath our feet. The Ancients' powers were vast, but raw and untamed, and they brought with them many a terrible calamity. But with love they held us in the palm of their hands. And in time, formed a Covenant with the likes of Man. With their power coursing through our veins, we held the line. As the days blended into weeks into the drone of eternity. Until one day..  .. the world in front of my eyes, was painted blue.   Kingdoms rose and fell, as time waltzed along into the Age of Man. Mountains became valleys. Forests turned to deserts to flourishing plains once more, and the stories of the Third Age became but a distant memory. Yet as the pendulum of time swings, the tendrils of the Old Ones will envelop the land of Rathe once more. Upon this lonely mountain pass that had remained unchanged for eons; a faint shuffle and a crack was heard, and then the scraping of metal on ice, as a mighty mountain of a man stirred from within his frozen slumber. His nightmares had kept him company throughout the Ages. He relived the badlands of his youth, scrambling to hide from the Old One's gaze. Sometimes his dreams took him to his formative years, when the vassals of Embras advanced, forcing them to the north as he took up arms for the very first time. Others sent him back to his days of glory as a mighty Shieldbearer, as the Ollin fought alongside the Ancients and held the line. Yet as he stirred, the flames of war subsided, and the pure scent of the mountain filled his tired old lungs. Their fortress was in shambles, frozen beneath a thick layer of frost. His brethren, they were trapped beneath sheets of ice, still frozen by the power of the Ancients. But as he gazed out into the distance, he saw a breath-taking sight. A bountiful world full of life and beauty; the paradise of his childhood dreams. But even as a new, unfamiliar energy coursed through his veins, he felt an emptiness in his chest. A void left by the broken Covenant. \"I need answers,\" he thought, as he set off into an unfamiliar realm. He would seek out his old allies; perhaps the Seers, or the Rosetta. For if he was awake, the Old Ones won't be far behind.",

A child\u2019s dream filled with soaring architecture and figures of grace, of a radiant spectrum upon which she floated to a glowing door. She reached out, brushed that portal with her fingertips. As it opened, so did her eyes, and she beheld the Library of Illumination for the first time.The hands that had touched that otherworldly door now held an orb of pure arclight, the very essence of Sol. When the Librarian found this little girl in the heart of the Great Library, when they saw the radiant array within her soul, they called her \u201cPrism\u201d, for no other name would suffice.

        "(Written by Nicola Price, edited by Tarryn Thomas, with illustrations by Nikolay Moskvin.)  In a golden city devoted to the pursuit of knowledge, a small group of scholars worked within the grand library, toiling over ancient records and illuminated tomes. However, as the months passed and they continued to read through the notes of their earliest predecessors, the more they began to notice that there were inconsistencies in the tomes of old. When the scholars dared to question these missing details and contradictions, they were cast out. Their own people turned against them, declaring them heretics and driving them from the city. Even when the scholars and their loved ones escaped the city walls, their former brethren continued to hunt them, persecuting them to the farthest corners of the land.   However, in their suffering, they came to discover a greater power. The pain brought them a renewed sense of purpose, opening the doorway to the Shadow, and revealing a place where the Light could not follow them; where they would be safe from persecution and death. They vowed to stand for the truth and speak out against the deceptions of the Light; to stand against the people who would silence them.   Chane was raised within the order of the Disciples of Pain. He was taught the history of humanity, the gravitas of the old ones, and the true nature of Solana. Like his brethren, he sought to harness the suffering of humanity, to welcome the bloodletting, sanctified torture, and self-flagellation which littered his own initiations into the Disciples. As his pain threshold grew higher, Chane felt his connection to the Shadow grow stronger, allowing him to see the true nature of Rathe for the very first time. In that moment of transcendence, he felt the true weight of his duty to humanity. After his many years of study and sacrifice, Chane\u2019s unwavering dedication was finally rewarded. Anointed an apostle of the Disciples of Pain, he had become a gifted caster and researcher, finding much solace and comradery with his fellow Disciples; together, they formed a family unified by their noble quest to free all of humanity.   Delving into all the documents of his order, Chane read through the notes of his predecessors, searching for something which would help them turn the tide. He scoured the records and tomes of the Scriptorium, a collection centuries in the making, reading the works of not only the Disciples, but all the former residents of the Demonastery. Time was a cruel mistress, and Chane could only watch as his reflection became ever more ashen, his failures exposed in every wrinkle. With each passing year, his quest only seemed more and more futile. His order had been searching for an answer for many years, and still lacked the answers they sought - what could Chane possibly hope to find?   A seed of doubt began to bloom, deep within his chest\u2014that is, until a whisper reached him through the halls of the Demonastery. A scheme came to fruition, and word passed quickly between residents and researchers, spreading through the Disciples of Pain like a fire. All of the Demonastery rose to the unspoken challenge, prepared to take on Solana after their centuries of hibernation. When the final pieces of the puzzle had fallen into place, and a dark figure shattered the veil between the worlds, the gateway to \u00edArathael, the eternal realm of the ancients, finally lay open.   Now, at long last, they finally had the opportunity they had been waiting for. After his many years of study and solitude, Chane was prepared, and a daring new plan sprung to mind. The old ones were rumoured to be unassailable, untouchable by the hands of man. Unassailable, that is, unless the Disciples harnessed the might of the ancients for themselves, and used their own power against them. As the Disciples ventured into the unknown world, Chane took careful note of the reports which came back, piecing together information on the ever-changing realm. The Disciples had been studying for many years, learning about the old ones, and as Chane studied their records he quickly identified one possible source of power for his order. Armed with the reports of his fellow Disciples, and with a team at his side, he grimly volunteered to venture into \u00edArathael and locate the Embra, ancient creatures whose raw power would lead them to the victory they so desired. When they had passed through the gateway, an unfamiliar, ethereal realm lay before them\u2014a vivid landscape seemingly torn asunder. Rolling, verdant plains met bloodstained wastelands; iridescent wisps transformed themselves into ashen wraiths; vibrant refrains clashed with dissonant screams. The land altered itself around them with every breath; landmarks flickered in and out of existence like a mirage, as if reality itself were rippling like the surface of a lake.   Their progress through the otherworld gradually decreased as time itself slowed to a jagged crawl. A darkened sky stretched out above the wandering party, casting the colourless landscape in shades of black and grey. As they journeyed farther into \u00edArathael, an iron cold seeped through the surrounding countryside, and the endless darkness began to weigh heavily upon their very souls. All sound around them dulled, blanketed by the oppressive silence, until finally they could not hear even the sound of their own breath. However, rather than instilling dread, the transformation only cemented the core of Chane\u2019s conviction; he read the Void in the blanket of shadow, in the deafening quiet, in the empty pits that yawned in their chests. They had arrived. Then the darkness snuffed out the last remnants of the light, leaving them completely blind, deaf, and unable to distinguish friend from foe. And yet, as Chane stood still, breathlessly waiting, a figure slowly appeared on the horizon. It radiated a faint, rippling light, like the bright afterimage which accompanies a wildfire; the wisp of smoke which rises from an extinguished flame. The dim, white-violet glimmer was just barely enough for Chane to make out the form at its centre, a plume of ashen mist and wrought gold, framed by dark wings. As the presence drew closer, Chane came face to face with the power he had sought for so long.   Ursur promised that power. Through him, Chane would have the power to bring his enemies to their knees, to bring the Disciples of Pain success, and to ensure that they would never again be at the mercy of Solana. It asked for only one thing in return\u2026 Chane. He would be bound to Ursur, a conduit for its power, and an emissary of the Void. Chane would help to grow the Shadows, and spread the darkness across Rathe. So long as he kept his side of the bargain, Ursur would provide the means for Chane to bring down the Light. With this brand new power flowing through his veins, Chane cannot rest, cannot let down his guard for a single moment, even after returning to the Demonastery. An ominous presence now lurks within his shadow, whispering in his ear, tempting him with promises of arcane strength and the allure of forbidden knowledge. Control is a relative concept to an entity such as Ursur, and Chane must tread carefully if he wishes to fulfil his duty to mankind. Even as he races to make the creature\u2019s power his own, feeding and placating it with the souls of the Light, Chane walks a razor-thin line on the very edge of the Void. One wrong move, and Chane\u2019s own soul may be lost forever.",

Ancient trees tower above the crowded canopy, casting shadows on saplings struggling toward the light.

Deep within the jungle, savage predators prowl through the shadows, while vicious scavengers fight to the death over scraps of meat. All those that call this place home, from the smallest insect to the largest tree, must fight tooth and nail for their continued survival.

Hide This is the harshest habitat in Rathe, a massive jungle filled with vicious predators and savage wildlife. Inside a small hollow, beneath the roots of a haldor, a small pup opens its eyes for the first time. This is a brute, one of the fiercest predators in the Savage Lands. Yet, as he crawls out of the pile of rotting carcasses, he is no more dangerous than a newborn jacara. Hunger drives him to leave the safety of his burrow, following the scent of fresh blood on the air. This will be his very first hunt - and may very well be his last. Small, weak and defenseless, the young brute is easy prey for anything that finds him. However, nearby, a pair of strix lurk within the dense undergrowth. They notice the brute immediately, lunging straight toward the helpless infant. With a wail, he tries to roll out of reach, struggling against the strix\u2019 iron grip. Even newborn brutes such as this one have incredibly sharp teeth, his canines tearing through one of their wings. Their panicked shrieks allow him just enough time to slip away, quickly fleeing back to the burrow. He curls up in his pile of bones once more, hungry, but alive. Perhaps later, he will have better luck in finding a meal. Kill or be Killed After a successful hunt, the brute feasts upon his prey. However, the scent of blood often draws nearby creatures, who come searching for a free meal. Even when he bellows in an attempt to intimidate them, the young brute is rarely seen as a threat.   Skera, peluda, ank\u2019is, brawnhide; kings of the jungle, fighting tooth and nail in a primordial wilderness. There is no rest, no respite. From the first light of dawn, the predators begin to roam, and their prey must constantly be on the move if they wish to survive. Ensnaring vines and vibrant flowers entice their prey into drawing closer, their curiosity proving to be their downfall. Even after the sun sets, the predators continue to stalk through the darkness, searching for sleeping prey to feast upon. This is a lesson repeated across the Savage Lands - you must always be ready for a fight. If you cannot defend yourself, you become another beasts\u2019 meal. If you cannot protect your own meal, you go hungry. The brute is up for the challenge, but these predators have sharp talons and massive tusks. Even with the brute\u2019s claws and strength, he struggles to hold his own. Yet while he often suffers injuries, he refuses to back down, either fending off the beast or escaping with some scrap of food. It is in this endless wilderness that the brute grew up, battered by the constant fight to survive. Some days, he is hunted, constantly on the run. Days would go by as he withered and wilted in starvation, hiding from a predator following his scent. Yet others would see him become the hunter, lounging within a secluded den with a full belly. As each season passes, the young brute grows. He becomes stronger, standing his ground against predators, no matter how large. The jungle sees him become a predator in his own right, marking out a place of his own within the Savage Lands. Bide Your Time Straying further and further from his birthplace, the brute travels north, to lands filled with larger, more dangerous predators. While the prey is plentiful, the beasts here are massive, powerful masters of the hunt. Roars and howls echo through the trees, fragments of bone coating the earth, carcasses scattered across the jungle floor. Toxic fungi, poisonous berries, and meat-eating plants spread across the landscape, preying on the weak and the unaware. However, any creature can fall victim to their primal curiosity. The brute continues to investigate that which should be left alone. Abandoned camps, narrow caves, hollows and burrows and barren wastelands, even the rare trails leading to the outer reaches of the jungle. He finds all kinds of things - metal carapaces; large clubs of wood; handheld talons and massive canines; furs and leathers and hides; shards of metal; carcasses, skulls and bones from unfamiliar creatures. Some things he takes, making a protective hide for himself, and a massive, spiked club. He feasts on strange creatures, with crystalline hides and stone shells. Yet the further he travels, the more dangerous the land becomes, with ever more predators lurking in the shadows. The jungle has become far more complex. Beasts roam in massive packs, while savage predators stalk through the shadows. Venomous bites and toxic scales ensure a slow, painful death; scavengers roam the trees in packs, searching for easy prey. The injured, the ill, the young and old; in this part of the jungle, any sign of weakness will spell demise. Meanwhile, furless, leather-clad creatures gather to the East. With no talons or fangs to speak of, they wield pieces of metal, their large packs and sheer determination outweighing their weaknesses. Tracks and bones left in the earth speak of hunters wearing silver shells, trampling everything in their path. While the brute has yet to encounter these strange creatures, he prepares himself for a fight, keeping a wary eye out for the tracks they leave behind.   For even the most experienced hunter, these are treacherous lands, and biding your time might well save your life. The brute lies in wait, skirting along the edges of a tall cliff face, avoiding the largest and fiercest beasts that would spell certain death. He avoids the barren wastelands and the strange lakes, the acrid scent of death in the air. After all, it is not only beasts that spell danger in the Savage Lands. Some areas of the jungle are dangerous in their own right, unfamiliar territories that promise a slow death to any creature foolish enough to enter. Never Back Down It does not last forever. The brute soon becomes a predator. Rhinar marks a place for himself amongst some of the most dangerous beasts in the Savage Lands. This is his territory, his kingdom, and any creature who dares to step foot within his land will die for it. Now fully grown, the fear and caution have given way to aggression, an overwhelming urge to carve out a territory for his own. Yet Rhinar grows ever larger, towering over the other predators of the jungle. He drives scraps of metal into his wooden club, the rashari branch he\u2019d once scavenged from the forest floor; adds the jawbone of another brute and the tusk of a young brawnhide.   Rhinar begins to hunt down predator and scavenger alike, any possible threat, any creature that consumes the prey that belongs to him. He fights tooth and nail, beating them down with his club and his fists. The first beast to challenge him pays dearly for it, a peluda that attempts to drive him away from its hunting grounds. He crushes its skull into the cold, hard rock, brain matter dripping onto the stony earth. The curve of his club sends skull fragments flying across the clearing, blood pooling onto the earth, strips of fur and hide hanging limply from the jagged wood. Rhinar tears into it with his bare hands, shoving mouthfuls of steaming viscera into his gaping maw. One by one, he destroys any predator on his land, devouring them whole. Scale or fur, crystal shell or venomous fang, he hunts them all. The crack of bone echoes through the trees, creatures fleeing from the overwhelming stench of decay that hangs in the air. Rhinar grows ever stronger on the constant feasting, consuming flesh, cramming the fresh organs down his throat by the handful. The silver-shelled hunters still lingered near the edges of his kingdom, elusive, only leaving faint tracks or an unfamiliar scent to mark their passing. Even as he roamed further from his hunting grounds, he could not follow their scent for more than a moment. Despite the warnings he left behind, they failed to retreat, tramping through the jungle as if set on a predetermined path. The hunger drives him further still, beyond the boundaries of his territory. He hunts larger and larger beasts, crushing them into the earth, throwing himself into fights with reckless abandon. Rage overpowers any remaining instincts for self-preservation, abandoned in favour of the steaming entrails that he devours from fresh carcasses. Ripping tusks from skulls with a single swing, toxic scales torn clean from their hide; not even the venomous bite of a rek\u2019vas can deter him from the overwhelming urge to destroy. His skin turns almost grey, covered in a slimy coating of marrow, blood streaked through his hair, viscera collecting beneath his nails. His rampage drives him ever further from his lands, seeking larger beasts and tougher fights. Rhinar\u2019s territory grows larger and larger, as he massacres more and more creatures in his endless need to consume and destroy. Bones and teeth form a chain around his throat, his body decorated in the trophies of his hunt. Rhinar\u2019s kingdom is silent, empty. Every remaining creature has fled; prey and predator, hunter and scavenger, all running from the beast that has carved out a home for himself in flesh and blood. Strength Rules All Dusk is the most dangerous time within the Savage Lands. The darkening night would strike terror into even the most seasoned hunters, as vicious predators emerge from their dens to stalk through the shadows, hunting sleeping, defenseless prey. In the dim light, a hulking shape storms through the overgrowth, mindless of the racket that it was creating. Rhinar returns from a successful hunt, his hide streaked with blood, stomping through the shadows as if daring any nearby beast to challenge him. Yet as he drew closer to his lair, he caught an unfamiliar scent on the wind, faint tracks marking the earth. Something had entered his territory, a pack of creatures hunting on his lands. Despite their blatant disregard for all warning signs, entering his land without hesitation, a faint smell of fear lingered in the air. His clearing was filled with strange creatures, dressed in shells of silver and gold metal. The critters flocked around his hut, poking it and barking at one another. While they looked small and sickly, something about the creatures gave him pause. Rhinar released a bellow, the roar echoing through the trees like a thunderclap. With a sharp clatter, the nine creatures turned to face him. Immediately, they sprang into action, the pack barking at one another as they moved to surround Rhinar, wielding massive metal talons. One member of the pack, clothed entirely in fabric, threw open his arms, revealing a stream of sunlight that burst through the air. The bolt grazed his side, searing his thick hide. The pack began to close in, brandishing their weapons as they yelled, drawing closer and closer, leaving nowhere for Rhinar to escape. More bolts of pure light blasted through the air, white-hot and almost blinding. Two of the creatures revealed large, pointed sticks, attached to lengths of white rope. They threw the weapons at him, and as the sharp prongs flew through the air, they pulled the rope taut over the top of his body. Struggling against the restraints, Rhinar fails to dodge their attacks, silver talons slashing through his thick hide with ease. Blood streams from the open wounds, coating the earth in crimson. When he tries to strike out at them, pulling at the ropes, he finds that their silver shells are as hard as stone, a sharp, hollow clang ringing through the trees. Even his claws fail to rip through the shell, and his strongest blows only serve to knock them off balance. Slowly but surely, Rhinar began to grow weaker, the world dulling to a hazy, burning red. A memory surfaced, taking him back to a warm, mid-autumn day; a young pup at the mercy of the wilderness, overwhelmed by fear. The endless fear turned to rage, fuelling a fire that flooded through his veins, bringing with it an all-consuming bloodrage. Rhinar charges forward, tugging himself free of the ropes, sustaining several gashes in the process. He bowled over one of the larger creatures, leaping toward one of the smallest members of the pack. Her fear was a sharp note in the air, the acrid scent stark against the fire of his bloodrage. A single blow to the side of her head sent her flying to the ground, and before she could struggle to rise, Rhinar leapt upon her. Tearing away her silver shell, he drove his fists into her, the loud crack of crushed bones echoing through the clearing.   The rest of the pack faltered for a single heartbeat, and in that same instant, Rhinar charged at another, crushing the creature\u2019s skull between his hands. Another crashes into a tree with a sickening crack, while a third falls to their knees, screaming. The scent of blood drove him into a frenzy, tearing through the clearing in an unbridled rampage. The rest of the pack rallied, holding their weapons aloft as they charged. Their talons slashed through the air, one of them cutting Rhinar\u2019s tough hide, a trail of blood streaming down his shoulder. He stormed into the heart of the fray, ripping one creature\u2019s head clean off its shoulders, its corpse dropping to the earth with a dull thud. One by one, they began to fall, faltering, bones crushing easily beneath the might of his blows. Even as they tried to escape, Rhinar felled them one by one, crushing their bodies into the earth. Finally, all was still. Standing above the carnage, Rhinar bellows, a challenge to fall on empty ears, no surviving beast to hear his challenge. His bellow echoed through the trees, signalling the birth of an apex predator, an alpha unmatched by any other.",

        "Lord Sutcliffe was once an ordinary member of the noble class, but he abandoned his title and lands in his quest for knowledge. He made a new home for himself within the Demonastery\u2019s ancient halls, spending many years studying the Shadows and reading about runes and rituals, perfecting his knowledge of the arcane arts. As he was one of the few members of his bloodline to be born without any aether affinity whatsoever, Sutcliffe could not personally practice any of the spellwork he was reading about. However, he was seeking to explore the true depths of the aether, in order to establish whether a man could artificially lay claim to the abilities of the arcane. In time, Sutcliffe\u2019s research evolved into the Arknight project: he sought to create a living weapon, a man who could wield both might and magic. In essence, he would transform a subject who had been born without aether affinity and unlock his ability to cast spells. Later, when he found that a fresh body had washed up on the shore near the Demonastery, Sutcliffe knew that his opportunity had come. Viserai was all that Sutcliffe had wished for and more; he proved that it was possible to artificially unlock aether affinity, and forge a potential power that every human might well carry. However, Sutcliffe struggled to keep control of his living weapon. With the Demonastery\u2019s creatures whispering in the new Arknight\u2019s ear, Lord Sutcliffe quickly found himself on the wrong side of the battle. However, as his disembowelled body lay cold and silent on the concrete, a strange creature approached, taking Sutcliffe\u2019s head for its own diabolical plans. Preserved with layers of runework, and bound by intricate spells, Sutcliffe is trapped within his own mind, carried around like a common trophy. The Disciples of Pain quickly came to possess his skull, and now bother him constantly with their inane questions, forcing him to suffer through their unending chatter about duty and sacrifice. While the odd researcher attempts to steal him for their own purposes, Lord Sutcliffe cares little about what may become of him\u2014as a disembodied voice trapped within a skull, his life is an unending torment of infuriating half-wits and idle conversation. Unable to escape, subjected to the whims of others with no recourse, Lord Sutcliffe can only dream of the day he enacts his revenge on the one who brought him to this dark fate; eventually, one way or another, he will find the means to make Viserai pay for his disobedience.

        "Illustrations by MJ Fetesio, colour by Sindy Wo, story by Nicola Price.   Amongst the isolated, peaceful quiet of the mountain ranges, long-forgotten clans hide themselves beneath a blanket of mist. They remain a secret to the other villages of Misteria, their names struck from every record, their continued existence a testament to the determination of their ancestors. Yet some of these clans would emerge once more, and reveal the secrets of Misteria\u2019s history. The Mugenshi clan, having secluded themselves long ago, remain afflicted by an ancient curse that continues to take lives long after their self-imposed isolation. Each year, a number of their clan waste away, their physical and mental wellbeing deteriorating as they descend into despair. While many believe that a cure is all but impossible, some wonder whether the possibility of a cure is worth risking the mountains beyond their ancestral home.   Stalemate Silence. The last of Katsu\u2019s words echoed through the room as he watched the grandmasters turn their faces toward him, expressions cool and unaffected, as still as a lake in the midst of winter. \u201cIt is not yet time.\u201d Master Takumi spoke, his voice a counterpoint to the stillness of the room. \u201cThere are things that have to be taken into consideration. Autumn is already upon us, and you know well that the winds are more active at this time of year. That aside, the clan is not prepared for such a journey.\u201d \u201cI am not asking for the entire clan to leave. Let me take just a few clan members with me, and we can begin the search.\u201d Katsu gestured to the doorway, to the distant sounds of people sparring outside. \u201cThere are others who would be willing to join me. If it meant possibly finding a cure-\u201d Another grandmaster raised his hand, waiting for silence before clearing his throat. \u201cThe clan has been dealing with the Seikan for generations. If there was a cure to be found, it would have been discovered years ago. As head of the clan, you have duties here that you must attend to. You have a responsibility to your people.\u201d   \u201cHow can I be responsible for my people when they continue to wither and die from an illness that we do not understand? During my Jokyoku, I spent years travelling across Misteria and never once saw its like. Perhaps the way to a cure lies beyond these mountains\u2026\u201d \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Master Saori interjected, shaking her head. \u201cWe cannot risk revealing ourselves to the rest of Misteria, least of all to the Great Households. It is not yet time, Katsu.\u201d \u201cWhen will that be? We lose members of the clan to the Seikan every year, as we have for centuries. When will it be the right time to finally begin searching for a cure, and find a way to save our people from this fate?\u201d The room fell to silence once more, every gaze fixed firmly on Katsu. \u201cWe will know.\u201d Takumi\u2019s voice broke through the quiet, as usual, his tone level and calm. \u201cWhen the time comes, you will be the first to know, Katsu.\u201d Divergence The village was tranquil in the early evening, as the clan had their evening meal and prepared for sleep. Only a handful of senshi were wandering between the buildings, some returning late from their training, others keeping a watchful eye over the Mugenshi Gorge. Each of them bowed to Katsu as he passed, pausing to bow back before continuing on his path. As leader of the clan, no one questioned Katsu\u2019s presence at this late hour. The very air around him was still as he made his way to the ancestral shrine, kodachi sheathed at his side. A faint breeze stirred as he passed into the shrine proper, slowly lowering himself to kneel upon the cool stone. It\u2019s been almost two years, and I am still no closer to convincing them. Katsu looked up to gaze at the sliver of night sky visible at the edge of the shrine, faint stars dotted against a sea of inky blue. They never have a reason, only excuses. They are afraid of leaving the gorge, afraid of change - they may never agree to my idea, or to look into a cure at all. Not when the information lies beyond the clan grounds. Slowly, he pulled a long bundle from behind one of the statues, peeling open the layers of fabric to reveal his supplies. For several weeks, he had been slowly gathering supplies to bring to the ancestral shrine, preparing for this exact moment. Despite their age and detached composure, the grandmasters were sharp as a tack. If any of them caught wind of Katsu\u2019s movements, they likely would have found a way to bring his plans to a halt. Quietly muttering an apology, he rewrapped the bundle and slung it over one shoulder, darting atop the shrine to balance on the edge of the rockface above. In a fluid motion, he pulled himself through the gap and out into the fresh air above, climbing onto the edge of the cliff. Crossroads The crescent moon was a thin sliver of silver in the night sky, its soft light muted by the dense storm clouds lurking on the horizon. In the cool night air, a figure slowly emerged from the mists, a straw hat casting his face into shadow. Howling winds coursed through the gorge behind him, echoing deep into the mountains and disturbing the peaceful quiet of the evening air. He turned to survey his surroundings, gaze sweeping over the landscape before him. Yet nothing else stirred, and he remained alone amidst the trees, a single figure cast in dark grey. His muffled footsteps carried him forward, darting along one of the ropes swaying between the cliffs. A well-worn map lay tucked into his shirt, marking the paths from village to village. Over his years of wandering, he had long since found the trails leading to Mistcloak Gully, marked only by the passage of travellers such as himself. While several years had passed since his last journey to the town, the path remained unchanged, cloaked by a thick blanket of mist.   Two nights and two days passed in quick succession, sleeping in the warm sunlight, and travelling by the pale light of the moon. A peaceful silence hovered over the mountain ranges, a layer of mist coating the plants in glistening dew. The calm evening air brought a lightness to Katsu\u2019s chest as he traversed the cliffs, wandering along the faint mountain trails. It had been many years since his return to the Mugenshi Gorge to take over as the head of the clan, and in the time since, he had almost forgotten how it felt to travel in this way. While a part of him longed for those peaceful days, taking his time as he journeyed from village to village, he remembered his purpose for leaving, and the duty he had to his clan. Yet on the third night, shortly after rising and continuing his trek, he paused, slowly drawing his kodachi. Eleven figures emerged from the mists, faces obscured by half-masks, eyes flashing in the dark. \u201cBe on your way,\u201d Katsu warned, voice low and calm. \u201cThere is nothing for you here.\u201d \u201cIt has been some time since we met a member of the Mugenshi.\u201d One man stepped forward, hands held palm-up before him, showing that he was unarmed. While his mask remained, obscuring the lower half of his face, a scar rose from beneath the fabric, the mark of a burn marring his skin. \u201cWe were simply curious - why would the head of the clan leave the gorge? We were under the impression that you already passed the Jokyoku.\u201d \u201cInteresting that you should mention the Jokyoku by name, when not one of you belongs to the Mugenshi clan.\u201d A wry laugh met Katsu\u2019s words, muffled by the cloth covering the stranger\u2019s face. \u201cThere is much that we know about your clan. We mean the Mugenshi no harm - you and your people keep to yourselves, and cause no trouble, so we shall not cause any trouble for you. We have not known a single leader to leave Mugenshi Gorge after completing their Jokyoku. If there are storm clouds on the horizon, we would be grateful to know of their presence.\u201d \u201cThese mountains have weathered many storms, should a simple sun shower cause so much concern?\u201d \u201cEven in the largest pond, a single raindrop causes ripples. We would know that rain is coming, so that we might prepare for any ripples heading our way.\u201d \u201cThere are no ripples to be found, nor any rain.\u201d Katsu shook his head slowly, fingers grasping the hilt of his kodachi. \u201cI see.\u201d The man\u2019s hand settles onto the hilt of his own blade, eyes narrowing. \u201cIt is a simple request; I would not think honesty to be so complicated.\u201d \u201cIf it\u2019s such a simple request, why are you so quick to draw your weapons?\u201d Katsu shook his head. \u201cI have no quarrel with you - I would prefer to continue on my way. There is no need for us to come to blows over this.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afraid that isn\u2019t entirely true. If you are so reluctant to share your plans with us, we shall have to convince you otherwise.\u201d The masked figures moved as one, darting through the shadows to strike at Katsu, their blades a flash of silver in the pale moonlight. Twisting out of the way, he called upon the wind, the air swirling around him as he moved to attack. The wind rushed outward in a torrent, streaming past his foes as he dodged past their blows. With a quick flick of his wrist, he slashed open one of the figures, turning on his heel to cut down another in the moment before they struck. The wind curling around him helped to deflect some of the assassins, pushing them back several feet, yet others continued to get closer. The flow of battle shifted as Katsu went on the defensive, gathering the wind around him as he began to prepare for another blast. Out of the corner of his eye, he noted a streak of crimson as more men raced into the clearing. They immediately joined the fight, closing in on his opponents with pinpoint accuracy. As most of his assailants were drawn away to defend themselves, Katsu struck out at the remainder with a blast of wind, sending them tumbling to the earth. His kodachi sung as he struck, quick as lightning, storming through the clearing to descend upon them. The group quickly banded together, gathering around their leader. He turned to glare at the crimson-clothed ninjas surrounding them, neither of the two sides moving to close the gap. \u201cYou rebels need to learn to stay out of our affairs. You cause far more trouble than you\u2019re worth.\u201d With a quick, sharp whistle, the man motioned for the group to retreat, maintaining eye contact with Katsu all the while. Every member quickly disappeared into the dark night, some of them clutching at their injuries as they darted into the line of trees. Those who remained in the clearing all turned in unison to look at Katsu, identities obscured by the pale masks covering the top half of their faces. One of the men removed his mask to nod at Katsu, his cheek marred by a small, curling scar. He gestured over his shoulder to where the other men had disappeared, raising an eyebrow. \u201cInteresting, that the Scales should single you out. It appears we have a common enemy.\u201d The rest of the group slowly gathered just behind their apparent leader; crimson robes draped over their armour. \u201cWhat would make you think that I\u2019m their enemy?\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t stop to talk to just anyone. For them to meet with you personally, you must have done something to catch their eye.\u201d \u201cNot quite.\u201d Katsu shook his head in response, eyes narrowed. \u201cIf they do not often speak to those outside their organisation, I find it curious that you would be so familiar with them.\u201d \u201cWe are a group known as the Crimson Haze. We\u2019ve been at odds with Aui\u2019s Scales for a couple of centuries now. They didn\u2019t exactly take well to our founder\u2019s agenda - and judging by the pendant hanging from around your neck, I\u2019m assuming that they have a problem with your clan, as well.\u201d \u201cIs a simple jade pendant so rare? I have seen many others on my travels.\u201d \u201cIt is the symbols carved into it that give you away. Usually, only members of the Great Households wear seals such as yours, but the one that you wear is different to any of the other clans. I can only assume that you\u2019re from one of the hidden households.\u201d \u201cYou speak as if you belong to one as well.\u201d \u201cIts name would mean nothing to you.\u201d The man shook his head. \u201cYour struggle is ours, stranger. You should join us; we may be able to help one another.\u201d \u201cYou have no way of knowing that.\u201d Katsu straightened, slowly sheathing his kodachi, though his hand remained on one handle. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that our agenda is the same.\u201d \u201cThis land no longer knows freedom. Our people are caged birds who have never flown. They do not know to miss it. They are hardly aware that they have wings at all. We would remind them.\u201d \u201cNot every creature with wings is destined to fly. Would you also see them tumble from their nests like a newborn chick, unable to use their wings to soften their fall?\u201d \u201cI would give them the freedom to make that choice for themselves. In any case, we may be able to help each other. What is it that you seek, wanderer?\u201d \u201cWhat I look for remains a mystery to us both.\u201d \u201cA burden shared is a burden lightened.\u201d A pause stretched between them, silence reigning as Katsu sized up the man before him. Despite the mask, he did seem genuine, and sincere about his offer of help. Beside which, if there was any chance that this man might know a possible lead on a cure, it was his duty to ask. \u201cMy clan has suffered from an illness for generations. It is a curse, and we have yet to find its source or why it continues to afflict them. I wish to search for some way to help, perhaps even cure the illness altogether.\u201d  After a long moment, the man nodded, looking thoughtful. \u201cWhile we may not have a cure to give you, there might be a way for us to help. Across Misteria, there are several hidden locations built by Aui\u2019s Scales to store and conceal anything that they want hidden from the public. Most hold scrolls, information collected by the Scales over the centuries, but some also hold old artefacts. The Crimson Haze were planning to send a team to infiltrate one of these strongholds. The particular building that we are targeting also holds several powerful artefacts. There may well be one there with curative properties. If not, you may still have the opportunity to find some information on what might be ailing your clan.\u201d \u201cYou would let a stranger accompany you into the heart of your enemies\u2019 home?\u201d \u201cWe would give a fellow wanderer a chance to free his people from their burden. Our paths are not so dissimilar.\u201d With no other leads on the disease, and little to lose, Katsu finally nodded in agreement. \u201cIf you are willing to have me accompany you, I would be grateful for the opportunity.\u201d Culminations Through the blanket of mist, the entrance to the building was completely obscured, a hairline fracture in the cliff face. Yet as they drew closer, the fracture slowly opened up to reveal a stairway leading down into the mountain itself. As they stalked down the hallway, the others slowly peeled away, leaving Katsu winding through the shadows alone. While he lacked a map for the building, the rebel\u2019s instructions were detailed, leading him past the guarded entrances and rooms, and into the heart of the stronghold. Those few times that he crossed paths with one of the Scales, he slunk back into the shadows, a simple breeze wrapping around him to obscure his presence. Finally, he reached his destination, not a single person alerted to the intruder in their midst. The darkened hall slowly opened up to reveal a large chamber, shelves lining the walls. Not a single artefact was anywhere in sight, nor any item that could possibly help him. Instead, hundreds of scrolls were stacked upon the shelves, neatly organised and covered in a very light layer of dust. Katsu stepped toward the centre of the room, where a single pedestal stood, constructed of white polished marble, with a jade tray containing six more scrolls. They were larger than many of the other scrolls in the room, free of dust and clearly well-cared for. Just as Katsu began to consider how to carry the scrolls with him, he suddenly paused, slowly turning toward the person slipping through the entranceway. Immediately, he noted the lack of weapons on the man\u2019s person, the light wrappings on his hands and feet, unobscured by the same fabric that hid his face and the rest of his body from view. Katsu drew his kodachi just in time, stepping forward to block the grandmaster\u2019s attack. Quick and strong, the master darted around Katsu, bombarding him with a series of sharp, swift strikes. His bindings bobbed back and forth as he struck out, using pure skill to work his way past Katsu\u2019s defenses. Katsu quickly whipped up a gust of wind, using the blast of air to push the master backward. It earned him only a fraction of an instant, but it was enough for him to shift the flow of battle, putting him back on the offensive. The pair danced around one another, blocking and dodging, trying to break through their opponent\u2019s defenses. Despite his speed and agility, the master was rooted to the earth, as if there was a chain physically connecting him to the ground. Even Katsu\u2019s strongest attacks could only make him budge an inch, earning a single second to try and land another blow. As he called the wind to him, he lashed out at the master, finally driving him back once more. Yet in one fluid motion, the master quickly struck out at a small, barely noticeable metal disc attached to the nearby wall. The quiet chime that sounded in responsible slowly grew, reverberating until it had reached the intensity and pitch of a large, brass gong. The sound echoed through the chamber, and Katsu heard more of these begin to ring in the distance, a warning to any member of Aui\u2019s Scales in the building. More men ran into the room, drawing their weapons as the master descended on Katsu once more. Within moments, he was defending himself on all sides. Calling the winds toward him, he felt the air whip into a gale, circling him with the force of a growing storm. The energy coursed through his kodachi, answering his beck and call. Growing stronger with each passing second, the wind coursed through the room, circling the chamber. The roar of the wind blocked out all other sounds as it reached the pitch of a full tempest, dragging each and every man in the room into its wake, Katsu standing steadfast in the eye of the growing storm. The gust struck the master with a sharp crack, sending him flying into the stone wall. In an instant, the fight was over as every member of the Scales was flung into the stone, knocking them unconscious. Yet as Katsu began to sheath his kodachi, more ninjas came down the hallway, heading straight towards him, swords drawn and ready to attack. With a quiet sigh, he began preparing for another fight, drawing the winds about him - but suddenly stopped to glance at the entranceway. Members of the Crimson Haze slowly began to make their way into the room - many more than the six that he had initially arrived with. The red fabric they wore did little to disguise the crimson stains marking their clothes, blood spatter coating their chests and arms. The ninjas belonging to Aui\u2019s Scales, taking note of the numbers before them, almost moved as if to retreat - yet before they could, the Crimson Haze were upon them, cutting them down without hesitation. Many of the rebels\u2019 present began slitting the throats of those lying on the ground, not bothering to wipe the blood from their blades. Slowly, their leader stepped forward once more, gesturing to the pile of scrolls, still sitting neatly in their jade tray upon the pedestal. \u201cI see you found what we were looking for.\u201d \u201cWhat happened to your small task force?\u201d Katsu intoned; his voice low. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d The man lifted his hand, curling his index finger. \u201cWe\u2019re here to take those scrolls, anything else is yours.\u201d \u201cNot until you tell me what information it is that you\u2019re looking for.\u201d That gave the man halt, Katsu watching as his hand dropped back to his side. \u201cNone of your concern. What was it that you said to the Scales?\u201d He paused for a moment, before nodding to himself. \u201cMy plans are no business of yours.\u201d \u201cThey become my business when you trick me into doing your dirty work.\u201d Katsu nodded to people lying around him, fingers tightening around his kodachi. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that you were using me as a distraction. Did you expect me to defeat the Grandmaster guarding the scroll, or had you intended for me to act as a buffer while you took care of the rest of the Scales in the building?\u201d The rebel leader sighed heavily, pointing to the pedestal. \u201cJust let us take them, wanderer. There\u2019s no need for conflict over such a simple task. You don\u2019t even need to lift a finger.\u201d \u201cNo. I may not know what your plans are, but I wager that they\u2019re not as altruistic as you choose to believe.\u201d \u201c...very well, then.\u201d The man shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that you are well on your way to ascending to grandmaster, but facing these odds, even the most talented ninja cannot fight alone and expect to walk away. I would prefer that we ended this without conflict, but you have clearly made up your mind. You will tire sooner or later.\u201d Yet before any of them could take a single step, Katsu held out a hand, halting the group. He turned his head slightly, looking over his shoulder at the air behind him.   \u201cI have felt the wind stirring for some time now. If you are so determined to keep an eye on me, you might as well join us.\u201d After a moment\u2019s pause, a breeze rolled through the room, revealing four grandmasters standing behind him. Each slowly drew their weapons, scrolls fluttering as a wind began to stir, rousing at the promise of a fight. As one, the Crimson Haze slowly began to retreat from the room, leaving the leader standing at the forefront. \u201cWe will remember this.\u201d With that, he left as well, disappearing into the shadowed hall. Katsu turned to face the grandmasters, bowing his head. \u201cI appreciate the support, though I\u2019m not sure why you followed me. I thought none of you were ready to leave Mugenshi Gorge just yet.\u201d \u201cIt was not the right time.\u201d Before Katsu could respond, Takumi held out a hand, pausing. \u201cHowever, when you decided to leave, it became the right time. You have shown that our clan is a secret no longer.\u201d \u201cSo, you were following me from the beginning.\u201d \u201cYou are Mugenshi. We would not let you face this alone.\u201d Takumi gestured to the scrolls. Katsu turned to inspect the contents of the jade tray, slowly unfurling the topmost scroll. A list of unfamiliar names stretched down the length of the parchment, each with some description of their last known location and current status. Some were held within Misteria, while others were scattered across Rathe. While the names of some seemed to hint at their abilities or properties, none were properly described, only their titles carefully noted down. Katsu turned to recite some of the names to the Grandmasters, watching as their expressions visibly changed. \u201cDo you recognise any of these?\u201d \u201cMany of these were thought lost, though it seems as if Aui\u2019s Scales has been tracking them all along.\u201d Master Saori paused, looking thoughtfully at the scroll in Katsu\u2019s hands. \u201cThe Crimson Haze mentioned that one of the artefacts might be able to lead us to a cure for the Seikan. It\u2019s possible that they were lying, but this is our best lead.\u201d Katsu gathered the scrolls, wrapping them carefully in his bundle. \u201cWe must find them.\u201d \u201cWhile many of these items are unknown to us, we can start by telling you of the ones we know. The Blades of the Seasons, the Masks of Misfortune, the\u2026\u201d \u201cYou support this?\u201d Leading the way through the darkened hall, Katsu glanced toward the grandmasters. \u201cI thought that you might try to stop me.\u201d \u201cIf you do not enter the tiger\u2019s cave, you will not catch its cub. We have sat idle for too long, and now that we have a lead, it is our duty to find a cure for the clan.\u201d As they emerged into the pale light of dawn, Takumi turned toward Katsu with a nod. Adjusting his bundle, Katsu turned to lead the way back home, leaping from the cliff face and disappearing into the mists below.",

Bravo was raised amongst the strongmen and animal acts of the Valdur, growing up alongside great, majestic cesari, and tiny meeps that darted from stall to stall. Many of his closest friends were members of the Maela; oracles, bards, skalds, enchanters and fortune-tellers, all breezing about the Everfest in loose silks and layers of golden jewellery. One of the Maela elders, a woman with fine white hair and a single eye, always made time for the young boy. She often spent time sharing the tales of Aria with him, spinning both fantastical tales and old legends. Bravo listened to tales of powerful enchanters and mysterious shamans, of magical artefacts and hidden wonders. It sparked a hunger for stories untold, and even as an adult, Bravo continued to seek out more. One day, when he was eighteen years old, Bravo decided to perform one of the old legends within the Carnival, bringing it to life upon the stage. Joined by a bard, two strongmen and an enchantress, he recreated one of Aria\u2019s most beloved tales; the legend of Magnus the Vigilant. The performances quickly became a staple of the Everfest, transforming into the Legendarium. As the act\u2019s popularity continued to grow, so did the size of Bravo\u2019s troupe. By the age of twenty-six, Bravo had amassed a troupe of over thirty performers and stagehands, with an act that was beloved by audiences across Aria. While the troupe had their fair share of followers, it was Bravo who often found himself at the centre of attention. He quickly found himself overrun by avid fans, his charisma and confidence earning him admirers everywhere he went. Yet even as he enjoyed performing, there was a part of him that still longed for more. Call to Adventure During a life travelling with the Everfest Carnival, Bravo had visited every village in Aria - yet no matter how many he travelled to, Aldevyr remained one of his favourites. A sprawling village, its buildings were scattered across the plains, flowers and herbs growing in rolling meadows. In the midst of summer, the Everfest made its way to Aldevyr once more, greeted with the sight of lush, dense meadows overrun with flowers.   With the Legendarium on hiatus, many of the troupe members had scattered across Aria, taking their time to visit other villages and explore. After spending the previous day helping to set up the many tents and stalls of the Everfest, Bravo was looking forward to spending his morning in the company of a nice, tall glass of alder cider inside the local tavern. However, just as he was fastening the buttons on his favourite crimson coat, he heard someone clear their throat. In the open doorway of his tent, Gawain and Morgan stood, imposing even in the light of the morning sun. Bravo had met the duo many moons ago, when they first arrived within the Everfest. Seeing their broad shoulders and muscles, their old-world appearance, and their stalwart natures, Bravo had approached and asked the pair to join his troupe. Reserved and taciturn, they were excellent at supportive roles, and quickly became staple members of the Legendarium. With the act currently on break, it was hardly surprising to see the pair with packs and travelling gear. However, when Bravo asked about their plans, they stared at him blankly. \u201cThe wayfinders have summoned us.\u201d Morgan was the slightly more talkative of the pair, his deep timbre echoing in the small space. \u201cWe leave for the Fractal Scar.\u201d Bravo looked from their grim expressions, to the packs upon their shoulders, to the weapons clasped at their sides. While Gawain and Morgan originally arrived at the Everfest with a pair of finely crafted greataxes, Bravo rarely saw the weapons. To see the greataxes once more, in the same moment that Gawain and Morgan were departing for the Fractal Scar at the request of a wayfarer\u2026 It reminded Bravo of the tales that they performed, of noble defenders leaving on a quest; an adventure that would take them across Aria in the pursuit of protecting the innocent. Gawain and Morgan, leaving on some grand journey; clad in armour and furs, wielding their greataxes with pride. Travelling for months, perhaps years; a journey taking them from village to village in search of their target, helping townsfolk and rescuing fair maidens from harm. At last, when they arrive at their destination, a great evil would appear before them, one that they are destined to defeat\u2026     Gawain and Morgan stood toe to toe with an ancient creature, something long forgotten by the people of Aria. Covered in scales, it raised its head with a bellowing roar and launched itself toward them. They fought valiantly, taking blow after blow as they worked together to defeat the beast. At last, Morgan got close enough to the creature to find an opening in its defenses. With a single swing of his greataxe, he beheaded the great beast, silencing it once more. They return to the townsfolk with the creature\u2019s head, arriving to the sound of cheering. The townsfolk hold a festival in their honour, a token of thanks for their valiant heroes\u2026 Bravo clapped once, decisively, nodding his head. \u201cI\u2019m coming with you.\u201d Gawain and Morgan looked to one another, the taller of the pair silently raising an eyebrow. After a long moment, they turned back toward him. To anyone else, Gawain\u2019s expression would have looked exactly the same, but Bravo had known him long enough to glimpse an air of resignation in his fixed stare. Morgan shrugged. \u201cWe leave at noon.\u201d It didn\u2019t take long for Bravo to gather his things, his pack still mostly untouched from arriving in Aldevyr the previous day. The last thing he gathered was his beloved mallet, Anothos, forged from polished wood and finely hammered silversteel. He stopped to visit his companions amongst the Maela, and those of his troupe who had stayed within Aldevyr. Once he had said his goodbyes, he left to meet Gawain and Morgan just beyond the outermost circle of tents.   The Hero\u2019s Journey The trio began their journey across Aria, making their way toward the massive crystalline cliffs of the Fractal Scar. The long days and balmy evenings of midsummer allowed them to spend more hours travelling during the day, spending their nights sleeping beneath the gentle light of the stars. The towns they passed through were more than happy to give them a place to rest, gifting them fruit, bottles of ale, and loaves of fresh bread for them to take on their journey. While travellers were common across Aria, the trio encountered more travellers than usual heading in the same direction as themselves, mysterious individuals that seemed out of place amongst the quiet, peaceful villages. An enchantress garbed in fine, iridescent silks; a strongman wearing simple stage armour; a wayfarer dressed in verdant broadcloth and worn brown leathers; a young woman with pale hair dressed entirely in kaie\u2019o fur; a giant of a man wearing a massive horned helm; and all of them travelling toward the Fractal Scar. However, as they grew closer to their destination, the atmosphere began to change. The towns and villages they visited seemed a little quieter. Despite the bright sunshine and balmy warmth of midsummer, there was no birdsong, no kaie\u2019o darting across the fields, no fianna roaming the landscape. It seemed as if there were no animals to be found at all, and none of the towns they visited seemed to know why all the creatures had disappeared. Each person they spoke to only described the feeling of waking up one morning to an unusual silence and venturing outside to find the plains empty. The three men began to feel an increasing sense of urgency. Every wayfarer they passed on their journey seemed to fly across the earth, racing past with their dowsing discs aglow. Some travelled on foot, traversing the rolling fields with surprising speed; others rode on the backs of fianna and vitr\u2019eo, their long braids streaming behind them as they sped past, in the opposite direction to the Fractal Scar. One night, they stopped in a village close to their destination, arriving to find the buildings dark and quiet. The townsfolk were nowhere to be found, their belongings left behind, plates still set on tables, mugs of cider and mulled wine still sitting out, half-empty. While Gawain and Morgan scouted out the rest of the village, Bravo searched the local tavern, looking for some sign of the people that had abandoned their homes. All of the casks were intact, chairs left sitting at their tables, the beds upstairs half-made. Some of the rooms still had packs in them, though none revealed any clues about their missing owners.   As Bravo began to make his way downstairs, he heard a quiet chitter. Anyone who visited the Everfest Carnival knew to keep an eye out for the mischievous meeps. Growing up within the Everfest, Bravo had developed a keen awareness for the sound of a meep making its move, the only warning one might get before the creatures ran off with one\u2019s purse. Sure enough, Bravo turned to find a meep sitting on the balustrade, its beady little gaze fixed pointedly on one of Bravo\u2019s golden earrings. It was incredibly rare to find a meep outside of the Everfest Carnival, the perfect environment for the tiny thieves. Yet here one was, and in a deserted village no less. Several minutes later, Bravo descended to find Gawain and Morgan waiting for him, leaning against the tavern\u2019s counter. As they turned toward him, he watched their gaze flick to his missing earring, and then to the meep sitting happily on his shoulder, a single gold ring strung onto its tail. In response to their confused looks, the meep chittered happily, waving its prize in the air.   Transformation According to Morgan, the wayfarers had set up camp near the Fractal Scar, rallying those who came to offer their aide. Marbles, drawn to the flash of sunlight reflected by the dowsing discs, led them from wayfarer to wayfarer, all making their way to the Fractal Scar. They were soon pointed in the right direction, and without Marbles\u2019 help, it may have taken them weeks to find their way through the icy plains. However, when they finally arrived at the village, the scene before them sent a chill down their spines. Unlike the gentle, rolling meadows of Aldevyr, the village that lay before them was an ashen husk of its former self. Houses lay abandoned, open doors swinging in the wind, blood smeared against the charred wood. The wayfarers had claimed a small section of land at the edge of the village, making use of the blacksmith\u2019s forge as a meeting place. Bravo approached one of them, a slender young man in the process of restringing his bow. Like many of the other wayfarers, he sat with his shoulders slumped, dark circles hanging beneath his eyes, skin sallow, eyes drooping closed with every other breath. Clearing his throat, Bravo politely greeted the young man, receiving a small, tired smile in response. Both stared silently for a moment, speech faltering, before Bravo finally gestured to the village around them. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d With a sigh, the young man began to share a report from one of the older wayfarers. Many years ago, a group of wayfarers had come across a massive sinkhole to the south of Aria, where the earth had suddenly caved in. Assuming that it was the work of the Flow, they filled in the sinkhole with the help of some local townsfolk and thought nothing more of it. Then, several months ago, in the early hours before dawn, a deep, rolling rumble woke several villages from their slumber. The ground quaked as people emerged from their homes, searching for the source of the sound - but found nothing. No changes had affected the land around their town, no shimmer in the air to show the influence of the Flow; it seemed as if the earth itself had mysteriously risen from a deep slumber. Some of the townsfolk set out to check the surrounding area, only to stumble across the cause by accident. They witnessed the surface of the earth begin to crack apart, and before anyone could think to get to safety, a swarm of creatures burst out of the sinkhole, clawing their way through the pile of loose dirt. The swarm descended upon the town and any villages near the Fractal Scar in a mindless rampage, slaughtering anything that crossed their path. The wayfarer called them dregs, humanoid figures with bloated, rotting bodies; their faces were a mass of melted, discoloured skin, dripping the length of their bony, twisted limbs. When they attacked, the air was heavy with the smell of burning flesh, bile and decay, steam rising from their open wounds. After giving Bravo, Gawain and Morgan some advice on how to kill the creatures, he told them where to go next; a village heavily hit by the attacks, where their help was desperately needed. For months, they travelled along the edges of the Fractal Scar, hunting down dregs and helping others who had stepped up to the task. Some of the villages that they came across were still occupied, their townsfolk carefully guarded by defenders in makeshift armour. Other villages lay abandoned, left vacant by fleeing townspeople, destroyed by the swarm of dregs following in their wake. Marbles helped in his own way, darting onto Bravo\u2019s shoulder to chitter at drained defenders and anxious townsfolk. His tiny, expressive face often brought a smile to people\u2019s faces, bringing some amount of levity to the tension hanging in the air. Even as his heart grew weary, Bravo began to grow accustomed to this new way of life, learning to use Anothos for true battle. Hunting dregs alongside Gawain and Morgan, Bravo developed skills necessary to keep himself alive, and eliminate the creatures that threatened his home. Final Battle The trio were making their way back to the wayfarer\u2019s base, seeking another quest, when they received word of a large swarm of dregs travelling further into Aria. A call went out to anyone within range, asking them to gather at a nearby valley. The trio immediately changed course and made their way to the meeting point, arriving to find a small crowd preparing themselves for battle. Even to one who had grown up in the Everfest Carnival, the collection of people gathered in the valley were mysterious and unfamiliar. Makeshift armour, worn leathers, faded silks and mended linens were worn alongside ancient helmets and layers of golden jewellery. Some looked as if they had stepped straight out of an act in the Everfest, others as if they\u2019d just emerged from the tavern for the first time in months. Yet all of them were prepared to fight, weapons at the ready, from bows to greataxes, hammers to daggers, enchantments to potions and poisons. The defender at the head of the valley, a towering man dressed in a patchwork collection of various pieces of armour, called everyone to arms. Those gathered leapt into action, following him over the hill and toward the village to face the swarm. A massive group of dregs milled about the buildings, eerily silent as they moved. Some of them dragged chains behind them, still attached to manacles around their neck. Others had scraps of torn fabric hanging from their skin or clutched at pieces of armour and leather. One had a human hand clasped in its claws, still wearing a strange metallic gauntlet on what remained of its forearm. As a battle cry went up, the swarm turned towards the commotion. The dregs were faster than Bravo had expected, moving quickly despite their bent and twisted limbs. The pungent smell of decay filled the air, thick and cloying, building at the back of his throat until it burned. Swinging Anothos overhead, he slammed the hammer into a dreg\u2019s skull, sending it colliding into the earth. Turning on his heel, he caught another in the temple before it could sink its claws into him. One of the larger dregs towered over him, a snarl escaping from somewhere behind the mass of melted skin covering its face. As it lunged toward him, he stumbled, and couldn\u2019t raise Anothos in time to stop it from tearing into his arm. Out of the corner of his eye, he caught a glimpse of another dreg advancing, its mouth hanging partially open as it threw itself forward. In that instant, Bravo suddenly felt the world tilt sideways, and a number of things happened in quick succession. A sharp pain burst to life behind his eyes, almost blinding him. The world took on a bright, hazy glare, an unnatural heat coursing through his veins. For just a moment, he could have sworn that he saw a spectral shape in the air before him, curling through the light in the same way that a cesari moves through the air. That same iridescent light coiled up his arm, charging through the polished wood of Anothos. The hammer shimmered, and a rainbow of colours burst forth, radiant and shining. Instinctually, he swung Anothos in a wide arc, and the mallet collided with the bottom of the dreg\u2019s jaw. Its skull immediately exploded, fragments of bone dropping to the grass at its feet. Bravo charged at the other dreg on his left, taking its head off its shoulders with a single swing, and a sickening, liquid crunch. Gawain and Morgan appeared in the midst of the fray, joining him on either side, their greataxes a flash of silver in his peripheral vision.     Dreg after dreg collapsed to the ground, bodies dropping to encircle Bravo as he made short work of the creatures around him. Every swing sent another dreg slamming into the earth, bones cracking beneath the force of every hammer strike. Before long, the last dreg fell, leaving the village silent as every person present slowly turned to look at their surroundings. A cheer sounded through the valley, ringing between the buildings as everyone gathered themselves, pleased to see their companions still standing. Gawain and Morgan turned toward Bravo, mostly unharmed, relief and pride colouring their usual deadpan expressions. In the coming days, they helped to search the hills for any remaining dregs, but with the majority of the force dealt with, it seemed as if peace would reign once more. Some of the townsfolk even began to return to their original homes, as defenders helped to set up protective measures and begin repairs. Bravo spent most of his time with the villagers, talking with the townsfolk and putting on short performances alongside Gawain and Morgan. Many of those present recognised from the Everfest Carnival, and he soon found himself the star of the show once more. While the villages had only just begun the long road to recovery, they put on a festival to celebrate their victory, making Bravo one of their honoured guests. He stopped to talk to each person that wanted to offer their gratitude, accepting their kind words with a smile and wink. After many months away from their home, Bravo and his companions finally decided to return to the Everfest Carnival. Saying their goodbyes, they began to make their way north, Marbles in tow. Homecoming The entire troupe was waiting for them when they arrived, welcoming them home with wide smiles and no small amount of celebration. The Legendarium\u2019s bard, Mikael, was bursting with new ideas, launching into a report of all the new stories he\u2019d learned while in the Milesian Ranges. Meanwhile, Marbles emerged from Bravo\u2019s pack, greeting the troupe with an excited chitter. While he was happy to see his family and friends once more, it felt strange to return to the Everfest after spending so many months away. Even as he greeted his troupe, his mind drifted back to the battles and the creatures they faced, the happiness expressed by each villager as they finally returned home. He had heard wayfarers speak of unusual changes in the Flow, and one had hinted that the dregs were not the only threat to Aria. Change was coming rapidly, and the events at the Fractal Scar were only the beginning. Bravo would not lose the Everfest to creatures like the dregs, and he would not let it be destroyed, like the barren villages that they had come across in their travels. He vowed to find a way to protect the Everfest Carnival, and all the other villages and towns that they visited across Aria. As Bravo greeted his companions, following them into the sea of tents with a broad grin, a single figure remained near the edge of the tents. An old woman, dressed in the loose silks and woven fabrics of the oracles, her golden jewellery marking her as one of the Maela. Her single eye gleamed as she watched Bravo leave, a small smile tugging at the corners of her lips. \u201cAt last, it is time. The Guardians shall return once more.\u201d",

        "\u2018Tis the night before Christmas, and the air is ripe for the robbing. A crooked shadow vanishes through a window, stealthy as a huntsman. From her vantage point across the street, Azalea traces the path Arakni cleared. Steep rooflines, yawning alleyways, a traverse more treacherous than she would dare. \u201cAgile,\u201d she observes. \u201cAnd sneaky too.\u201d \u201cNone sneakier,\u201d agrees Lena Belle as she offers the ranger a brew. \u201cI call this one Festive Flare. No harmful toxins!\u201d Azalea glowers at the grubby bottle. \u201cHonest? I spent two days bent over a barrel after your last concoction.\u201d Lena Belle shrugs. \u201cBacteria, booze\u2014the boundary is fuzzy. Besides, you needed time off.\u201d \u201cGive it here then.\u201d Azalea takes a swig of the caramel liquid and smacks her lips like a toff. \u201cNot bad,\u201d she admits as she passes the bottle back. \u201cFrom what is it brewed?\u201d \u201cCentennial loaf-mold and skatrat. Fortified with Blood Rot, thrice stewed.\u201d Azalea winces as the gorge rises in her throat. Lena Belle offers a reassuring smile, and an overly firm pat on her hooded cloak. \u201cThe distillation kills all the pathogens. Nice, meaty backend though, right?\u201d Azalea\u2019s retort is stopped short by the opening of the Tekla Toy Factory from the inside. Arakni\u2019s masked face peers out, turning this way and that as they scan the pavement. They give a jaunty wave as they open a sewer grate and drop into a maze of effluent. \u201cArakni\u2019s doing this for the kids?\u201d asks Azalea with a grimace. \u201cSqueakers support squeakers,\u201d answers Lena Belle. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s Christmas.\u201d She gives the ranger a merry wink. \u201cI still remember those socks you gave me when I was barely ten.\u201d Azalea recalls it clearly. A rare moment of pity. Lena Belle has never let her forget! \u201cAnd you\u2019ve given me socks every year since,\u201d complains Azalea. \u201cPurple with gold stars last time.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Another of those too hard pats on the back. \u201cNo gold stars this year. That would be a crime.\u201d \u201cGlad to hear it. Now where the bloody rot is Dash?\u201d On cue, the object of Azalea\u2019s impatience rolls up, her steam-wagon spouting aphotic gas. The mechanologist dismounts her contraption and greets them with a rowdy, \u201cHelloooo!\u201d Azalea winces for the second time that night before cautioning Dash with an urgent, \u201cShoosh, you!\u201d \u201cSorry,\u201d whispers Dash when they\u2019re close enough to hear. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see the kids\u2019 faces when they unbox the presents this year.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s just load up before we end up in boxes ourselves. The Enforcer kind, with bars.\u201d \u201cTrust me,\u201d assures Dash. \u201cI have just the apparatus.\u201d She produces a clunky brass controller, draws out the antenna and taps some buttons. With a bleep and a blop, an automaton crawls out of the wagon. Before Azalea can say, \u201cDregs-dammit! Enforcers,\u201d the wagon is runners-full of toys. Stolen for the squeakers, courtesy of the Expanse\u2019s most ungrateful girls and boys. \u201cAll aboard!\u201d yells Dash over the approaching sirens. \u201cOff with our hoard!\u201d adds Lena Belle, to Azalea\u2019s chagrin. The steam wagon lurches forward, almost bucking Lena Belle off the back. Azalea\u2019s quick reflexes save her from a tumble and a term in the Coppertown tank. They hold on for dear life as Dash adds more pedal to the metal. Skidding around corners. Whistling past Enforcers. Speed at nitro level. And it almost works. To the screeching of brakes, the wagon comes to a shuddering stop. \u201cThe jig is up!\u201d Squawks a pursuing Metrix cop. \u201cThrow out your weapons and keep your hands in the air!\u201d Azalea shoots Lena Belle a baleful glare. \u201cThis is why I should never listen to your ideas.\u201d \u201cExcept for this one,\u201d answers the alchemist with another merry wink. With a flourish, she produces her bottle of Festive Flare drink. With deft hands, she yanks an arrow from Azalea\u2019s quiver. Lashes the bottle to the shaft with a stained festive streamer. She unstoppers the bottle, shoves some cloth in its neck. Then she lights a match with a nefarious flick. \u201cCount to three,\u201d she tells Azalea. \u201cAnd watch for the flash.\u201d \u201cFinally.\u201d Azalea straightens her bracers. \u201cTime to take out the trash.\u201d The arrow arcs across the sky, a flaming comet of doom. The blockade explodes with a resounding boom. Dash cranks the steam wagon back into gear. \u201cUrgent delivery, coming through!\u201d And they streak through the wreckage down a dark tunnel destined for HQ.   \u201cIt\u2019s perfect!\u201d hollers Dash as she waggles the plasma globe up and down. \u201cFirst, a cup of Festive Flare, and now I have a gift?! Thank you, Lena Belle!\u201d The alchemist blushes, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome\u201d, then looks at Arakni perched nearby. It seems the assassin is admiring their new, more festive disguise. \u201cIt\u2019s an animal from Aria, apparently. A snowfawn. Do you like it?\u201d Arakni nods, either in approval or bemusement\u2014it's impossible to define it. Azalea hasn\u2019t seen Lena Belle this happy since she poisoned the Blackjack guards. The party was a success, squeakers scampering in from all corners, arm in arm. Dash laid on a magnificent feast, clocked to her expense account at Centennial Foods. And Arakni put on a pantomime, though its frightful finale dampened the festive mood. The entire event almost brought a drunken tear to the self-serving ranger\u2019s eye. A moment of weakness wiped hastily away. Mercenaries don\u2019t cry, they survive. She does, however, give in to childish excitement when a present is passed her way. Azalea tears the parcel open.

        "\u201cThis is like no other place in Rathe. Life here isn\u2019t some wheel that turns from sun to moon, work to sleep. Life in the Pits ferments, humanity\u2019s scraps foaming and frothing into a heady brew.\u201d Whitetail stretches out his arms to encompass the kinetic clamor of the street. \u201cIntoxicating, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cSure is,\u201d answers Uzuri, only sure of one thing: that Whitetail likes the sound of his own voice. She walks with him through hawkers and hustlers, harlots and hucksters, all working on their next score. If the Pits is a brew, it\u2019s one that gets you drunk on hope, then drops you in the gutter with the roaches and rats. Uzuri\u2019s not been here that long, but the runaway learned fast not to drink too deeply of the Pits\u2019 dubious delights. They round a corner of precariously stacked shanties. Whitetail points out a busy marketplace where fishermen sell anything from blindseal to bloatfin\u2014monsters of the Seethe hauled ashore for the desperate digestion of the Pits\u2019 hungering inhabitants. \u201cThat\u2019s where I took Baron the Butcher.\u201d Whitetail\u2019s smug smile takes on a wicked edge. \u201cDisemboweled the big bastard with his own gutting knife. And up there\u2026\u201d He points to a looming chimney spewing noxious smoke. \u201cI dropped Madam Rouge into a smelting furnace.\u201d He places his hand on Uzuri\u2019s shoulder, much to her displeasure. He only gets to keep that hand because she needs the work. Needs it bad. \u201cCross the wrong people and you get your name on a contract,\u201d continues Whitetail. \u201cThat\u2019s the Spider\u2019s business.\u201d Her business too, if this deal goes well. \u201cWhere\u2019d you hear about me?\u201d she asks, masking her eagerness with nonchalance. Whitetail removes his hand and waves it dismissively at no one in particular. \u201cFrom the same people you made sure to inform of your exploits.\u201d Uzuri covers a twinge of pride with a casual shrug. Her mother always said that spreading words is like sowing seeds. As a merchant on the Metrix to Misteria trail, her silver tongue touted her tantalizing tek to any ear within hearing. \u201cYou\u2019re highly spoken of, kid, by some very low down people,\u201d continues Whitetail. She allows the \u2018kid\u2019 bit, for now. \u201cSame could be said of you and your nest of killers.\u201d He breathes in the compliment, then exhales a peppermint-tinted question. \u201cYou killed anyone before?\u201d A boy in Misteria. Did he deserve it? Uzuri still isn\u2019t sure. She\u2019s killed worse people since. But Whitetail reminds her of that big-mouthed youth. \u201cOnly when they get in my way.\u201d \u201cWell, this one stands between us and a tidy payout.\u201d Whitetail passes her a sketch and a purse of tallics. \u201cOverseer Crichton. Blackjack\u2019s Mining.\u201d Uzuri covers her surprise; makes a show of hooking the purse to her belt. Suspicion follows. A Blackjack\u2019s overseer is a big hit, too big to entrust to an unknown like her. Whitetail should have contracted one of his experienced nestlings. Uzuri wonders why he hasn\u2019t? They pass under a woven bamboo archway into Ankomeido. Home to the misfits and malcontents of Misteria, Ankomeido is a claustrophobic quarter of teetering apartments and squirming side streets, connected to each other by a criss-cross of neon cables and steaming washing lines. Too similar to the cliffs and ropes of Misteria for Uzuri\u2019s liking. She\u2019s happy to visit this part of the Pits for payment, but doubts she\u2019ll ever visit for pleasure. \u201cWhy do you want him dead?\u201d \u201cNo reason either of us needs to know.\u201d He stops near a noodle house, sniffs at the enticing aroma of fried chicken. Real chicken, by the smell of it. Not the usual \u2018sewer chicken\u2019. \u201cThe Spider doesn\u2019t work for favors or influence,\u201d recites Whitetail, like he\u2019s reading from a rulebook. \u201cCoin is the Spider\u2019s only currency.\u201d \u201cMy kinda philosophy.\u201d Uzuri tries to suppress her rising anxiety. The more she learns, the more she wants to work for the Spider. But is this the job to get her in the door? Or is it something else? \u201cHow do I find him?\u201d \u201cThe Leaf House on Sori 16. You know it?\u201d Uzuri nods, giving nothing away. She knows it, and she knows who runs it. This is an opportunity to learn more than Whitetail is telling her. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a package waiting for you at the front counter.\u201d Uzuri plays along. \u201cGot people doing your spying for you?\u201d \u201cThe Spider is nothing without its web,\u201d quotes Whitetail. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d She turns to go. \u201cDon\u2019t hold back on this job,\u201d advises Whitetail, the smugness in his tone making Uzuri\u2019s skin crawl. \u201cDo this and I\u2019ll take you on full time.\u201d The offer sets her heart a-racing. But she plays it cool, shooting him a sharp look aimed to puncture his swollen head. \u201cAnd I might consider accepting.\u201d Uzuri turns her back on Whitetail and heads for The Leaf House. She can feel him watching her like a dreg eyeing a sewer chicken. Doesn\u2019t matter. Whatever game Whitetail is playing, she\u2019s going to win it. She\u2019ll prove herself worthy of the Spider. The Leaf House is busy when Uzuri gets there, humming with conversation, clinking with porcelain pots and cups. The wait staff sweep between the packed tables, graceful in their embroidered gowns and elegant, jade-pinned hair. A turned out waitress greets Uzuri with a professional smile. \u201cTable for one?\u201d she asks. \u201cPackage for one,\u201d answers Uzuri. \u201cWhitetail sent me.\u201d The waitress bows and produces a small parcel from behind the counter, wrapped in red rice paper. \u201cWith compliments from Jemjang,\u201d offers the waitress as Uzuri takes the parcel from her manicured hands. Uzuri tears the paper apart. The documents inside confirm her suspicions: it\u2019s a suicide mission. No way Whitetail would\u2019ve wasted one of his experienced nestlings on a contract like this. \u201cI want to see her.\u201d The waitress meets her demand with a tolerant smile. \u201cYou may make any further information requests to me and I will be sure to pass them on.\u201d \u201cPass her this instead.\u201d Uzuri takes a coin from her pocket. Its golden sheen glints in the lantern light. Around the hole punched in its center, a striped tiger slumbers. She flips it into the waitress\u2019 waiting hands. Her painted eyes flicker with recognition. She bows deeply and hurries off through a side door, returning moments later without the coin. \u201cJemjang will see you now.\u201d The waitress shows Uzuri into a cluttered office and leaves, shutting the door with a soft clink. Uzuri pauses for a moment before turning to face the fixer. Jemjang\u2019s perched on a cushioned chair behind an elaborately carved desk, resplendent in a silk dress, her face painted to perfection, her graying hair coiffed with care. She appraises Uzuri through gold-rimmed spectacles, and doesn\u2019t seem to like what she sees. \u201cNot what you expected?\u201d snaps Uzuri. \u201cYou have your mother\u2019s eyes. How unfortunate.\u201d Uzuri bites back a retort, looking instead at a painting pinned to Jemjang\u2019s wall; a group portrait surrounded by the notes and observations of Jemjang\u2019s trade. A younger version of the fixer stands front and center, flanked by Uzuri\u2019s parents. Gathered behind them, tough and tattooed women and men pose for the painter, muscles flexed, eyes cold.   \u201cI thought you might help me,\u201d states Uzuri, deadly calm. \u201cFor old times\u2019 sake.\u201d Uzuri\u2019s father told her all about the Running Tigers and their smuggling business. Weapons. The occasional narcotic. Njeri handled Metrix, Hisato looked after Misteria, and Jemjang kept the thoroughfares open between them. A smooth operation, until it wasn\u2019t. \u201cHisato betrayed me.\u201d \u201cHe just wanted out. New life.\u201d \u201cYour mother\u2019s idea.\u201d \u201cDoesn\u2019t change what you promised them.\u201d Jemjang nods, her jaw tight with grudging respect. \u201cYour father\u2019s stubbornness. Your mother\u2019s wile.\u201d Uzuri shrugs. \u201cI work with what I\u2019m given.\u201d \u201cWhat would you have me give you?\u201d Uzuri tosses the documents onto her desk. \u201cA way out. All I see here is a dead end.\u201d \u201cYou realize Whitetail isn\u2019t doing this one for the Spider. Gimlet Mining wants to muscle in on Blackjack\u2019s action. Crichton dies and Gimlet will owe Whitetail a substantial favor.\u201d Uzuri points at herself. \u201cAnd one less mouth to blab about his side hustle.\u201d Jemjang drums her long, lacquered fingernails on the desk, weighing her options. At last she turns to the pigeonholes behind her, pulls out a scroll and passes it to Uzuri. Unfurled, it turns out to be a map, drafted by Blackjack\u2019s Mining Incorporated. Jemjang takes a brush from her desk, dips it in a well of red ink, and marks an X on the yellowed parchment.   \u201cWhere Crichton\u2019s mansion now stands,\u201d she explains. A second stroke of the brush marks a spot some hundred strides from the first. \u201cYour way out. A mine shaft, covered and forgotten.\u201d Uzuri thrusts the map into her jacket pocket and retrieves the documents from Jemjang\u2019s desk. \u201cKeep the coin. I\u2019ve no further use for it.\u201d \u201cBe sure to tell your father that we\u2019re even.\u201d \u201cOf course, next time I\u2019m in Misteria.\u201d Meaning, never. That night, Uzuri is delivered to Crichton\u2019s Maw estate in a stinking meat wagon. She waits in her cramped secret compartment until the overseer\u2019s servants carry the cured pork away, then sneaks into the shade of his towering mansion. Over the pounding of her heart, Uzuri hears the wagon rumble out of the grounds, tall iron gates clanging shut behind it. She\u2019s locked in now, behind brick walls patrolled by Blackjack\u2019s archers, their quivers bulky with incendiary arrows. The mansion itself is a magnificent display of ego. Stained-glass windows. Copper flashings. Bronze effigies of Blackjack\u2019s founding figures. All of it perched on a Northmaw ledge, positioned to catch that most rare of Pits commodities: sunlight from the pit mouth above. The ground patrols prove too frequent for her to climb the brickwork without being seen. She needs to make a gap. Uzuri steps out of the shadows in front of an armored hulk of a man. Startled, the merc opens his beard-rimmed mouth to raise the alarm. Her throwing knife hits him between the tonsils. Choking, blood gushing down his jaw, the guard yanks the knife free. Uzuri ducks in with her dirk, aiming to jam it into his jugular. He\u2019s quicker, less distracted than she\u2019d hoped. He catches her wrist in a gauntleted hand, squeezes so hard that the chain links dig into her skin, drawing blood. With his free hand, he raises his mace, fixing to tenderize her like a steak. Out of desperation, Uzuri musters her ability, imagining a different weapon. The merc gurgles and chokes, impaled through the neck by the sword Uzuri now grips in her hand. He releases her and staggers as Uzuri pulls the sword free. She uses his own momentum to push the dying man behind a broad statue, then cleans and sheaths her weapon, a dirk once more. After retrieving her throwing knife, she climbs the mansion like a spider up a web.   Using her glass-cutting tool, she accesses a window on the third floor, stalking through the quiet corridors until she finds the master bedroom. Crichton is a plump parcel wrapped in sheets, boxed in by his four-poster bed. A gift for Uzuri to rip open. She hesitates, dirk in hand, having killed no one in cold blood before. In self-defense, as vengeance, yes. But this man\u2014he\u2019s done nothing to her. She grits her teeth, clamping down on that pang of guilt. Coin is the Spider\u2019s only currency. This is the business. The dirk is gone, replaced with a straight razor. She places her hand on Crichton\u2019s forehead like a mother checking the temperature of a feverish child. He stirs, but doesn\u2019t wake until Uzuri draws the razor across his throat. His eyes snap open. He gasps for breath but sucks in nothing but blood. Uzuri leans hard on his forehead, pinning him to the bed as he struggles in vain. Blood soaks the sheets, seeps into the mattress, as Crichton\u2019s movements weaken and finally stop. Uzuri takes her hand from his forehead, brushes his eyelids closed with her fingertips, and wipes the razor on his pillow. By the time the blade is clean, the razor has become her dirk once more.   Outside, an alarm bell rings. The dead guard has been discovered. Uzuri saws off a couple of plump fingers for proof and pops them into an oilskin pouch. Then she\u2019s off at a sprint, rushing past the rousing servants, hurtling down stairs until she\u2019s stopped in her tracks by the thumping of hobnailed boots on carpet. An exit presents itself as a bronze maiden and a lead-light window. She hefts the nude, smashes the glass, and dives through. She hits the ground hard, despite her attempt to roll through the impact. Winded, lungs and guts burning, she stumbles to her feet, pressing on at a limping run. From the walls, the archers adorn her path with explosions, their incendiaries erupting to either side, spraying her with dirt. She weaves as best she can, making herself a tough target until she reaches the mine shaft marked on Jemjang\u2019s map. It\u2019s boarded shut, planks nailed down so tight that it\u2019ll take precious minutes to pry them loose. Uzuri takes a throwing knife from her belt and lays it flat on the wood. As she moves her hand away, the knife disappears, replaced by a stick of dynamite. She waits. Moments later, an incendiary arcs down towards her\u2014an admirable feat of marksmanship by a ranger on the wall. Uzuri rolls away, settling into a crouch close by. Too close. Her ability isn\u2019t an exact science, unable to predict the potency of nitroglycerin. The incendiary arrow ignites the dynamite on impact. The explosion is deafening. Shrapnel peppers Uzuri, shards of metal and splinters of wood tearing through her clothes, lacerating her skin. She shields her face, winces through the pain, then looks with weeping eyes at the smoking hole left behind. She dives in, but not before gifting the archers an obscene gesture. The next evening, bathed and bandaged, Uzuri finds Whitetail at a bar called The Drop. While he makes a good fist of hiding his surprise, Uzuri can tell that her appearance has put a dent in his composure. She sits at his table and drops Crichton\u2019s fingers in his wine jug. Whitetail eyes them with distaste, and then her with even less pleasure. Uzuri rests her hand on the leather grip of her dirk and meets his baleful glare. \u201cCoin is the Spider\u2019s only currency,\u201d she quotes, voice as smooth as silk. \u201cYou want more?\u201d \u201cI exceeded expectations, didn\u2019t I?\u201d \u201cHow much of a bonus are we talking about?\u201d \u201cDepends how quiet you want me to be.\u201d Whitetail sighs, then takes a purse from his belt and pushes it across the table. She picks up the pouch, enjoys the heft of tallics inside. \u201cThanks. Almost enough.\u201d \u201cAlmost?\u201d The arrogance is back, accessorized by a deadly glint in his blue eyes. \u201cNothing else you need to give me. In fact, it\u2019s something I want you to keep.\u201d \u201cWhat is it?\u201d \u201cYour promise.\u201d   Whitetail laughs, impressed. \u201cAlright, kid. Guess you might as well learn from the best.\u201d He offers her his hand. \u201cWelcome to the Spider.\u201d Uzuri takes his hand in hers. The other remains wrapped around the handle of her dirk.

        "No sovereign could ask for a guardian more loyal, more devoted to his duty. He was the first volunteer through the breach at Tchankem Castle, one of the bloodiest battles in Volcor\u2019s visceral history. The soldier who pulled his wounded commander through Serpent\u2019s Crescent on a makeshift sand skiff. The protector who shielded his lord wizard from a rival\u2019s attack, an arcane assault of such ferocity that it almost claimed his life.   A valiant Volcai, sworn to protect what he believes to be good and just. The eyes and ears of vigilance. The raised voice of alarm, and the clenched fists of retribution. But what if his fervor were to blind him to the true nature of his people? We are equal parts fair and foul, and misfortune is the weight that tips the balance. Yoji did everything by the book that day, line for line, word for word. He doubled the patrols and tripled the sentries. He banned the Dragon Festival revelers from the surrounding streets and alleyways. He secured each lock and barred every entry not vital to the running of the palace. No-one would escape the sight of his soldiers. Nothing would pass without a word of warning. Or so Yoji thought. How could he know of traitors planted long ago? Of turncoats stitched from fear? Of dark dreams plotted while he slept? How might a soldier of leather and steel imagine schemes woven from silk and shadow? A lone man trying to peer into a vision conjured by a network of minds. Yoji wished to follow his Emperor into death, to be taken in chains to the Obsidian Coast and cast from Dragon\u2019s Peak. An honorable death that might redeem some small portion of his shame-shadowed soul.   Chancellor Yama, leader of the Ezu Dracai faction, would not allow it. Why waste a loyal subject, even one so blinded by the Alshoni faction and their deluded devotion to a dying dynasty? Better that he live as a condemned man, serving his sentence with halberd in hand. Better that he learn to live in dishonor, and view the world through the eyes of those who would most threaten it. Betrayed by his own garrison, now surrounded by Ezu enemies, Yoji chose to first purge himself of trust. Then he purged the palace of the untrustworthy. Like a mason repairing a decrepit fortress, he ripped out the rotten wood, uprooted the crumbling stones. Some he exiled to the Blackrock quarries of the north, a chance to reconsider their loyalties. Others he cast upon the rocks below Dragon\u2019s Peak, a haunting sight to stiffen the backs of those he spared. Some he simply \u2018disappeared\u2019, so quietly, so thoroughly, that it was as if they never existed. With neither mercy nor remorse, he vivisected the palace\u2019s lower ranks and cauterized the infection until only the incorruptible remained. Remorse has thrust Yoji into a sovereignty of suspicion. He patrols a land haunted by paranoia, doggedly protecting the memory of his fallen master. In Yoji\u2019s mourning heart, he feels the smoldering embers of the Dynasty. Though they cool and fade, he clutches them ever tighter. He will continue to serve his true master until his dying breath.    Written by Edwin McRae and Rachel Rees.Directed by Robbie. Illus. by Sam Yang.",

        "War is on the horizon. While the people of Rathe prepare for battle, some have their minds on protection. From chestplates to gauntlets, tunics to masks, armour can take many forms, and some provide far more than just basic protection. As the brewing storm draws closer, heroes across the land prepare to take shelter, and defend their homes from the enemy.   Dark magic always has a price. Deep within the shadows, spilled blood forms the roots for forbidden spellwork, aether sacrificed for raw power. Runes flaring in the darkness, armour forged from skin and bone; a parasite which will eventually take his life. With time, the pain dulls... skin turning to stone, aether flowing beneath the surface like magma beneath a volcano. The final piece, completing a project years in the making - but was it worth it?     Mist pools within the mountain ranges, concealing those who move in the dead of night. Survivors from dozens of clans travel together, united by catastrophe, carrying only their grief and the clothes on their backs. Their names will be lost to time, their ventures forgotten, but tonight, they claim the answers they\u2019ve been looking for.     The knight\u2019s new armour gleams as bright as the noonday sun, crimson cloak billowing behind her as she kneels before the crowds. At the very centre of the amphitheatre, she is resplendent, head bowed, golden hair billowing in the breeze. While her shoulders bow under some unspoken pressure, her gaze flicks to an older warrior standing nearby, and her expression brightens, filled with clear purpose. As she begins to recite her oaths, her firm voice cuts through the hushed quiet of the crowds, laced with unwavering determination.      Back straight, chin high, the guardian stands tall, raising her gauntleted fist to the sky. The stories will speak of the woman who threw herself into battle, brave and true, fighting alongside her brothers and sisters with honor. Long after their passing, their armour remains, set upon the ancient battlefield, a humble monument to those who came before.      Fueled by greed, the wizard makes a bargain with the beyond. Drawing upon power unknown to most of mankind, he channels the energies that make up his world, and is consumed. The man becomes a vessel for the very power he sought to wield, disappearing in an instant\u2026 but the gloves remain, thrumming with arcane power, lying in wait.     In the depths of the jungle, the remnants of campsites lie scattered amongst the trees, scraps of fabric clinging to battered skeletons. Between the broken standards and shredded packs, pieces of metal gleam in the faint light, attracting nearby scavengers. In a small clearing, amidst the grime and the mud, a polished skull lies forgotten, languishing in the dark. Its seared markings bear the scorch of aether, an anomaly accompanied by a tuft of silver fur, eye sockets flashing scarlet in the undergrowth.      The city of tomorrow never truly sleeps. Massive corporations battle in the constant war of progress, scientists forever chasing their next breakthrough. Cast in shades of violet by the neon lights, agents stalk through the streets, infiltrating every level of the city, gathering intel on behalf of their patrons. On the battlefield of discovery, knowledge is everything, and corporations will pay anything to protect their secrets\u2026 or dethrone their enemies.",
        "The Hero's name is Kassai. They have the following short description: Across the scorched wastes of Volcor, generals clash in their quest for power. While the generals are trapped in endless warfare, not every fight is won on the battlefield; sometimes, the greatest threats come from within.Kassai was once the daughter of a powerful general, well-versed in the language of war.

        "(Warning: story features content that may be upsetting to certain readers.Viewer discretion is advised.)  Uzuri savors her whisky as she stares out over the sprawling cess that is the Pits. From the balcony of The Drop, a bar she owns under an assumed name, Uzuri lets her thoughts drift with the vapors that rise from the sunless streets. She can afford this momentary luxury, for everything is in its place. Timed and measured to the nth degree. The faintest scrape alerts her to Arakni\u2019s presence. \u201cThere\u2019s a front door, you know. Quite a nice one, too. Hand carved.\u201d Perched on the railing, Arakni stares at her in silence. \u201cBut then you\u2019re not one to appear where most would expect.\u201d Arakni climbs down from the railing and approaches Uzuri\u2019s table. \u201cShow me the contract.\u201d They produce a scroll from under their tattered cloak and place it on the table. Uzuri raises a manicured eyebrow. \u201cThe Emperor of Volcor? You didn\u2019t think to question it?\u201d Quicker than thought, Arakni stabs a knife into the parchment, right through Uzuri\u2019s signature. She slams her glass on the table in response, and is satisfied to see Arakni flinch, if only a little. \u201cIn the future, you have any misgivings, you voice them. Or in your case, write me a bloody note.\u201d Uzuri pushes her chair back, giving herself room for what\u2019s about to happen. As if on cue, the windows of The Drop explode inward. The floorboards tremble as armed women and men land among the startled patrons. Glass crunches underfoot as the bar empties in a panicked stampede, leaving only Uzuri, Arakni, and thirty masked assassins. The leading cutthroat tugs down his kerchief, revealing a cruelly handsome face. Framed by clipper cut hair, piercing blue eyes and chiseled cheekbones, is a smug smirk that Uzuri has suffered for years. \u201cWhitetail.\u201d \u201cUzuri.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re paying for those windows.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t answer to you anymore,\u201d sneers Whitetail, his condescending laugh echoed by Blave and Carva. Two more of Uzuri\u2019s spider\u2019s nest turned traitor. No loss. The siblings share a lack of imagination that has oft tested Uzuri\u2019s patience. \u201cSo, who do you answer to now? Can\u2019t be the Spider. Last time I checked, we don\u2019t pick sides.\u201d She taps the contract. \u201cNice forgery, by the way.\u201d Whitetail shrugs the compliment off. \u201cThere are finer currencies than cash. What\u2019s money without power?\u201d Uzuri makes like she is going to stand, but Whitetail lifts a hand and wraps the other around the grip of a holstered blacktek pistol. \u201cNo need to get up.\u201d He glances in Arakni\u2019s direction. \u201cWe\u2019re only here for them.\u201d \u201cTidying up?\u201d \u201cTerms of the contract. Nothing personal.\u201d \u201cDeath is as personal as it gets.\u201d Uzuri steps out from behind a pillar, her throwing knife drawn. There is no sign she moved, no passing of time. It\u2019s as if she were at the pillar all along. The knife streaks across the room, nicks the ear of a ducking assassin, and sails out through a broken window. There is a muffled ring as it strikes something metallic outside. \u201cYou missed!\u201d scoffs Whitetail. \u201cDid I?\u201d With a clatter of running chains, steel jaws drop from the ceiling and snap up half a dozen assassins, hauling them thrashing and screaming into the rafters. Blood showers down, the only rain the Pits ever sees. A bulky shadow looms in the broken window. Glinting eyes look up at the entrapped and dying. \u201cWriggle little fishes,\u201d rasps Riptide, his voice harsh as a falling guillotine. Uzuri nods her approval, waits until Riptide has faded back into the shadows, then gets to some butchery of her own. Carva is her first target. She drives her dirk into the woman\u2019s throat before she can go for her sword. With a twist, Uzuri rips open her jugular and voice box, and with a yank, pulls the shredded mess out of her neck. Carva clutches at the gaping hole under her chin, staggers, and falls. Uzuri leaves the traitor to drown in her own blood. The next assassin lunges at her, dual hatchets swinging and slashing. Uzuri drops under the assault and sweeps the attacker\u2019s legs out from under them. Then she\u2019s on him, pinning his arms with her knees as she plunges her dirk into his navel. She drags the blade up through guts and chest, its edge so sharp that it cuts through bone as easily as flesh Blood fountains from the man\u2019s bisected body. A crossbow bolt streaks over his twitching cadaver, aimed at a space that Uzuri no longer occupies. Several strides away, she steps out from behind a pillar and flicks a copper-barreled dart into the face of the bewildered arbalist. The dart explodes on impact. Brains and fragments of bone spray from the woman\u2019s ruined head, blinding the startled swordsman beside her. Uzuri makes the most of the surprise. She leaps across the intervening space like a cat pouncing on a rat, skewering the swordsman through the eye, her long dirk punching a bloody hole out the back of his head. She jerks the weapon free and takes cover behind the abandoned cocktail bar. Out of the corner of her eye she glimpses a flurry of violence, Arakni thinning the crowd. She wipes blood and cerebral fluid from her dirk while counting. On \u201cthree\u201d her loyal killers burst through the entrance, punctual as expected. Widow leads the pack, scything through the hirelings, severing limbs and decapitating heads with brutal abandon. Amber, Jape, Florence, and Silka fan out across the room, stabbing and slicing those distracted by the sheer ferocity of Widow\u2019s assault. Uzuri rolls across a table, lands in a crouch and sends a throwing knife at Blave\u2019s leg. He goes down screaming as the blade bites deep into the meat of his thigh. She readies another knife for Whitetail, but the coward is sprinting for the balcony, too fast for her to intercept, even with her abilities\u2014always was a fleet-footed bastard. The fleeing fink leaps over the railing, and for a sweet moment Uzuri thinks he has chosen the fall over a slow and painful death at her hands. Instead, Whitetail pulls a cord in his bulky jacket and out billows a silken parachute. Uzuri sprints to the railing and watches the turncoat sail out across the Pits. She raises her throwing knife, knowing the target is out of range, and opens her mind\u2019s eye to the alternatives. The knife is gone, replaced by a short, barb-headed harpoon. She takes a couple of steps back, aims high, and launches the harpoon off the balcony. The missile arcs gracefully through the air and descends upon Whitetail\u2019s dangling form. There is a distant cry as it hits him in the back.   It was never going to be a fatal blow. Too far, even for Uzuri. More of a memento. Something to remember her by. She turns and marches over to Blave. Around them, gasps and groans from the dying have replaced the sounds of fighting. Only Blave remains to tell the tale, and Uzuri is quick to slice out the juicy bits. The traitor bleeds out on the floor as Riptide lumbers in through the door. He nods a greeting to Arakni, then studies Uzuri with bloodshot eyes. \u201cBlave say anything interesting, boss?\u201d \u201cContract came from a ganger.\u201d \u201cMiddle man?\u201d \u201cHas to be. Too big a corpse for those little maggots.\u201d \u201cWhich one you want to go after first?\u201d \u201cAll of them.\u201d \u201cHow?\u201d Uzuri turns to Arakni, her smile as thin and sharp as a knife blade. \"Arakni has a bounty on their head. Let's see who wants to collect it.\"   Melten Wick squints up at the window that encircles the cavern\u2019s entrance. This is the place the squeaker spoke of, her voice all a-trembling as she described the masked monster hiding within. A tip-off worth a few tallics to the squeaker, but a hundred thousand to the crew who serves up Arakni\u2019s head on a platter to Whitetail. Wick doesn\u2019t know what the assassin did wrong, and doesn\u2019t much care. He\u2019s got mouths to feed. He beckons for his gang to follow as he passes under the dusty, broken panes. In the wan light, the scarred leader looks like a half-cooked sausage returned to the oven for extra crisp. It\u2019s the price he\u2019s paid for his love affair with the flame. A cost he\u2019ll happily suffer, over and over, for the warming blaze and sweet scent of roasting flesh. Wick lets his eyes adjust to the gloom, the vast chamber lit only by a few green phosphor lanterns\u2014Metrix issue\u2014stolen from a Blackjack\u2019s Mining compound. There, tucked into a makeshift shelter of fallen detritus, a misshapen figure lies dormant, the occasional twitch a sign of sleep. Wick presses his scarred finger to the skinned surface where lips once existed\u2014a request for discretion from his fellow Torched\u2014then gestures for the gang to surround the prey. Arakni\u2019s reputation precedes them, but Wick doubts they\u2019ll last long against his lot. Too many, even for the Huntsman. He raises the spout of his flamethrower, ignites it with a spark from the starter, and shoots a gout of fire into the air. Arakni leaps off the heap, pouncing like their namesake upon one of the Torched as they rush in. The assassin's knives make swift and bloody work of the hapless ganger, but the victory is short-lived. Hemmed in by firebrands and bursts from flamethrowers, they soon lose any chance of attacking or escape. Two of Wick\u2019s bravest get close enough to hurl a net over them, bearing the quarry to the ground. A grin cracks the smooth cast of Wick\u2019s melted face. Too easy. Perhaps the Huntsman\u2019s reputation is mere speculation. Perhaps\u2014 A guttural roar derails his train of thought. From a side tunnel enters a hunched figure clad in skins and chain. With her sinewy arms, Cager hauls on a pair of leashes, restraining a brace of slavering dregs. Behind her, the rest of the Freak Show spills into the cave. As if in answer, Wick hears a belch from the other side of the cave. Hands on hips, pale gut a sweaty avalanche, Slab glowers at the Torched. His hulking Blockheads spread out, readying for the charge. Through the shattered glassway clatters another deplorable mob. Their bone bodyware makes a rattling racket as the Numbskulls take up fighting positions. Their skeletal overseer, Marrow, raises his scimitar as if to make one of his obscene pronouncements. Whatever depravity he intended to declare drowns under the weight of an explosion to the rear of the cavern. The diminutive Madame Fuse dances in through the dust, followed through the fresh-blown entrance by the marching boots of her Jawbreakers. It would seem that the squeakers have told tales to all and sundry, squeezing as many tallics from this bounty as possible. He\u2019d threatened to slow-roast that girl over a barrel fire if she shared her news with anyone else, but who could know how many of her fellow street roaches she\u2019d told first? Wick sends an almighty blaze into the air from his flamethrower and addresses the uninvited guests. \u201cYou lots wants a burning?\u201d he screams. \u201cYou can comes get one!\u201d It\u2019s the match that lights the fireworks. With whoops and howls, shrieks and growls, the gangers join in battle. Moments later, Wick finds himself engulfing a Numbskull in a crackling inferno. The victim shrieks and stumbles about, crashing into others as she beats the flames with her burning hands. Her collisions set a Freak and one of Wick\u2019s own Torched ablaze. It matters not. When the flame is hungry, it will eat what it pleases. He spares a glance for his prize, just in time to see Arakni slit the net open. Wick levels his flamethrower at the escaping assassin, but a curious detail gives him pause. Arakni\u2019s ghoulish facade is gone, replaced by a gas mask. His racing brain has barely hurdled this surprise when another confounding fact enters the fray. A metal canister lands at his feet. He looks up to see more canisters tumbling down from the roof, dropped by a line of shadowy figures. The subsequent concussion blows Wick clean off his feet, the ganger landing hard on the concrete floor. Winded and stunned, Wick looks up to see Slab looming over him. The Blockhead leader is saying something, but Wick can\u2019t discern it over the ringing in his ears. Then Slab coughs and splutters as gas rises in a green haze. Wick tries to get up but his head is heavy, his eyelids droopy, his limbs unwilling. Slab crashes to the concrete beside him, unconscious. Wick has no choice but to slump down beside his arch enemy, unable to fight the choking intoxication. Through the mist strides the lean, long-coated figure of Uzuri, her masked assassins at her side. She points out the gang leaders she wants interrogated. Her nestlings get to work, all except Arakni. They take a knife from their sleeve, jab the point into Wick\u2019s arm, and use his blood to paint a message on Slab\u2019s bloated stomach. Uzuri stifles a laugh. \u201cA bloody note. Cute.\u201d She reads the message, then signals for her crew to take Slab away. \u201cOne of them paid Whitetail off, but they\u2019re just the next link in the web. And what\u2019s the best way to unravel a weave?\u201d Arakni waits, still as a trapdoor spider. \u201cYou cut one thread at a time.\u201d She leaves her nestlings to clean up and strides out through the glassway with Arakni at her side. Riptide\u2019s waiting for them. The ranger falls in opposite the assassin, two contractors guarding their boss, watching for threats so that Uzuri can walk and think through the Pits\u2019 mean streets. She lost the first move, but the second is hers. Whatever the game, she and her nest are done with playing by others\u2019 rules. They\u2019ll not kowtow to the codes of petty gangsters, nor to the laws of Metrix. They\u2019ll heed no pledge to regent and realm. Assassins of the Spider live and die by their own accords. For they are Outsiders.  ...  (to be continued)   Written by Edwin McRae and Rachel Rees.Directed by Robbie Wen. Illus. by Sam Yang.",
        "Dash burst through the window in a shower of glass shards, stomach lurching as she fell forward, plunging through the air. With a flick of her wrist, a hook extended from her gauntlet, her fingers closing around it as it tore into the side of the building. Her body jolted as it immediately slowed her descent, sparks flying where the metal connected. Laughing wildly, she felt her heels connect with the side of the building, metal screeching as she slid down the face of the Needle. A scientist called out as she flew past, thumping on the window of his laboratory. The shriek of metal on metal filled the air, ringing loudly as she watched the ground rise up to meet her. Her feet collided with the solid pavement, knees bending as her boots took the brunt of the force. With one final whoop, she retracted the hook and bolted, angry shouts filling the air as scientists emerged from the Needle. \u201cCome back here! Someone grab Thiroux\u2019s blasted daughter!\u201d Dash ran for the edge of the street, launching herself over the railing and falling into the darkness of the Sprawl. Propelling herself off a rooftop, she made her way onto the streets, falling into step with some of the workers making their way home from the mines. No one looked in her direction as she reached into one of her pouches, withdrawing a small metallic orb. \u201cKinda small, aint\u2019cha?\u201d Turning it back and forth between her fingers, she found a connection port on the side of the orb, and a few gaps in the plating. \u201cThought you\u2019d be bigger. Still pretty heavy, though,\u201d Dash muttered ducking through a side-street as she headed for the Midtown Markets.   The pounding in his head was what woke him up, slowly registering the familiar sharp ache that followed a blow to the back of the head. Hissing through his teeth, he tried to raise a hand to check the wound, but immediately realized that he couldn\u2019t move. After a long moment, Ricky Royce opened his eyes, squinting in the bright light of day. A tall man with a patchy beard kneeled in front of him, gaze dark as he stared blankly at Ricky.   \u201cMornin\u2019 sunshine. Y\u2019been sleepin\u2019 for ages.\u201d He scratched his beard idly, squinting. \u201cWasn\u2019 sure if ya\u2019d wake up.\u201d Ricky didn\u2019t answer, gaze flicking to the side as he took in the rest of the room. Wherever they were, the building was certainly rundown, showing all the usual signs of the abandoned buildings of early Metrix. The bright shine of copper had given way to vivid, waxy blue-green patina, water-trails leaving patterns on the walls. Several of the windows had been boarded over in an attempt to conceal the shattered glass panes, while the rest seemed to shake in the slightest breeze. \u201cHey, I\u2019m talking t\u2019 ya.\u201d The man snapped his fingers in front of Ricky\u2019s face, drawing his attention. \u201cYer Ricky Royce, yeah?\u201d \u201cWhy y\u2019 lookin\u2019 fer him?\u201d Ricky glared, jaw clenching. It was beginning to come back to him - turning up at the Cogwerx factory, finding the shipment unguarded, these crazy gits running in to claim everything. None of it explained what they were doing here, or why this lot hadn\u2019t killed him yet, or why the man knew his name. \u201cYeah,\u201d the man grinned. \u201cSee, we gotta plan to cause some trouble for Metrix, and \u2018parently, this kid\u2019s good at that. \u2018Course, you don\u2019t know where he is, maybe I kill \u2018ya now and be done with it.\u201d \u201cAl\u2019rite, al\u2019rite.\u201d Ricky rolled his eyes.\u201d Yeah, that\u2019s me.\u201d \u201cGood. Here\u2019s the deal-\u201d \u201cNo, no deal.\u201d He cut the other man off, shaking his head. \u201cY\u2019 gotta show me the others first. I don\u2019t wanna hear anything until I see \u2018em.\u201d The man whistled through his teeth, and a moment later, the doors opened to reveal some other members of the man\u2019s group each holding one of the street kids who had been part of Ricky\u2019s heist.\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019re the other two?\u201d \u201cDead, kid. Died at Cogwerx. Y\u2019know those security bots? Shot \u2018em full\u2019a holes.\u201d Setting his jaw, Ricky looked over at the members of his gang, but before he could look for injuries, the group took them away, closing the door once more. The leader - for that\u2019s what he had to be - took a knife out of his pocket, twirling it between his fingers. \u201cYer the leader of that little group, aint\u2019cha? If ya want those squeakers to live, y\u2019 gonna do what I tell ya to.\u201d He struck out with the knife, driving it deep into the wall next to Ricky\u2019s head. \u201cBoss wants us to cause some trouble. Yer gonna help us make sure we ain\u2019t gonna be interrupted \u2018fore we\u2019re ready. You try to trick me, mess up my plan? I\u2019mma cut up your little buddies one by one. Got it?\u201d After a long moment, Ricky tipped his chin upward, glaring. \u201cFine. Whaddya want me t\u2019 do?\u201d   As she drew closer to the heart of Metrix, Dash made a left turn, disappearing into an alleyway and scampering up a ladder to the levels above. As she emerged above the Sprawl, entering into the Coppertown sector, the air became thick with the sharp, sour smell of sulfur, smoke turning the world around her slightly hazy. Climbing higher, she made it up above the stalls of the Midtown Markets, scouring the crowds below. Checking that she was out of sight, Dash activated the induction chamber, withdrawing the connection cable from her D.R.E.S.S. and attaching it to the port in the orb. The orb fit perfectly into one of the ports on her belt, sliding into place with a neat click. Light travelled along the surface as the device came to life, drawing on the power of the induction chamber. Lifting her arm, Dash watched as her D.R.E.S.S. calibrated with the orb, sending its display to the unit on her wrist. Slowly, it began to calibrate, giving off a faint pulse as it attuned to her surroundings. Then, finally, it let out a single shrill beep. \u201cOkay, little buddy!\u201d Dash grinned, slowly turning as she listened for feedback from the device. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d   Choosing a direction at random, she began to walk toward the outline of Zinnia Park, listening carefully. In a day, she could cover the whole of the Midtown Markets, and a part of Lowlake. The next led her down into Coppertown, scouring every street for the slightest signal from her device. However, it continued to stay silent. Every time Dash booted up the device, it would release a series of high-pitched beeps, confirming that it had calibrated correctly. Yet after weeks of searching Metrix sector by sector, Dash was beginning to wonder if perhaps the device hadn\u2019t calibrated correctly after all, or if there was an issue with the connection to the induction chamber. Old Metrix was a failure, and the East Rise didn\u2019t produce a single signal. As she entered into the Expanse, she was startled to discover that the orb began to signal, beeps sounding faster and faster as she drew closer to the source of the tenatan. A light blinked into existence on her display unit, flashing a faint green. On closer inspection, she discovered that it was producing eight different directional lights, seven of which were currently inactive. When she turned around, the light turned off, and a different one lit up instead, now turned to face the same direction that the other light had been pointing previously. \u201cOh, hell yeah!\u201d Holding the device out in front of her, Dash ran toward the northeast, watching as the light blinked faster and brighter with every step. Finally, she found the building, coming to a halt in front of one of the Teklo Corporation\u2019s various laboratories. \u201c...Oh. Right.\u201d It was the first of several, as Dash found herself pulled to multiple laboratories, peeking in the windows to discover scientists in the process of testing raw tenatan. After several long, exhausting days, Dash finally eliminated the Expanse from her search, turning her attention to the Sprawl far below. \u201cAt least I know it works,\u201d Dash muttered as she slunk back to her room, tossing the device onto her worktable. \u201cWhere the hell are you, rat boy?\u201d   Ricky watched silently as the men unloaded several cases from Cogwerx, sorting the weapons into piles. Anything explosive was placed on the main table, sorted by size and yield. Armed with the knowledge of their combined explosive power, seeing them all together made his skin crawl. They set \u2018em off by accident, we\u2019re all gonna be ashes and dust. \u201cSo, we can def\u2019nitely get in through the access panel?\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d Ricky responded, rubbing a hand over his face. \u201cWe dunnit plenty, all y\u2019need is a driver and y\u2019 can pry the scanner righ\u2019 off.\u201d \u201cAn\u2019 yer sure there ain\u2019t no guards?\u201d \u201cNah, they just got the scanners fer security.\u201d \u201cAlright.\u201d The leader, Mo, lifted his bat over one shoulder. \u201cY\u2019know what happens if we get caught.\u201d \u201cI know.\u201d Ricky sighed. \u201cAlready said, I dunnit before. \u2018S gonna work fine.\u201d \u201cRight. Hope so, for your boy\u2019s sakes.\u201d Mo signaled to the rest of the group, whistling through his teeth. \u201cHey! Listen up. Boss wants this done neat and tidy, no fuck-ups. Bigger the mess, more we get paid, but any o\u2019 you assholes screw up and get us caught early, we ain\u2019t getting nothin\u2019. So get your shit together, and let\u2019s move!\u201d   Dash was passing through the streets of the Sprawl, head bowed over her wrist display, when the device suddenly gave off a beep. She came to a standstill in the middle of the path, slowly turning as a very faint light appeared, pointing north. \u201cThank fuck for that,\u201d she breathed, beginning to walk in that direction. Yet as she drew closer, the light growing stronger, it suddenly switched directions, pointing west. \u201cDon\u2019t you short-circuit on me.\u201d As she turned to continue walking, it beeped loudly at her, all eight lights flashing simultaneously. \u201cUp top somewhere, huh? And movin\u2019 fast, from the looks of it.\u201d Dash craned her neck backward to look at the levels above, quickly identifying the nearest ladder. The moment she passed into the streets of Coppertown, it switched directions once more, pointing toward the center of Metrix. Dash ran as quickly as she could, relying on the extra boost from the D.R.E.S.S. as she made her way through the crowded streets. Passing through Lowlake, she scrambled up a ladder, hauling herself up into the Midtown Markets. Here, the crowds were even more dense, as Dash struggled to slip between the masses. Squeezing between the stalls and patrons, Dash realized the device was directing her up once again. Using a nearby stall as a stepladder, she craned her neck to scan the crowds, looking for a gap in the flow of traffic. Her gaze landed on a ladder near the entrance to Goode\u2019s, leading up to the miner\u2019s walkways that connected to the Gigadrill Elevator. Dash cursed under her breath as she pushed her way through the crowds, grasping onto the ladder and throwing herself onto the upper level. As she climbed higher, the signal grew stronger and stronger, leading her onto the maintenance level of the Gigadrill Elevator. Past the main walkways, there were few miners up here, making it much easier for Dash to follow the bright blinking light. The device led her to one of the maintenance doors, its access panel torn off the wall. Dash quietly reached down and turned the tenatan detector off, silencing its shrill beeping. Her heart raced as she listened carefully, staring at the loose panel. Beyond the door, she could hear faint shouts and the occasional curse. Drawing in a deep breath, she wrapped one hand around the hilt of her Teklo-assigned plasma pistol. When she raised her hand, pistol at the ready, she was proud to note that her hand barely shook at all. Moving closer, she spotted someone standing near the door, just out of sight behind a pillar. The guard stood close to the edge of the metal path, gazing out over the city. With a deep breath, she dashed across the space between them and shoved, sending him flying onto the lower level. Ignoring his angry shouts, she booted the door open, pointing her pistol into the maintenance room. In front of her, six men burst into action, reaching for nearby weapons. In a split-second, she glanced at the back wall, where she saw one man with a patchy beard standing next to Ricky, who met her gaze with a slack-jawed expression. \u201cGrab a fucking weapon, rat boy!\u201d Dash yelled, backing up as one of the men came at her with a nail-studded baseball bat. Even as she ducked, avoiding the blow, her mind dimly wondered why the man was wielding a bat, and not one of the endless varieties of Cogwerx or Teklo-produced weaponry.   Gathering herself, she lashed out with her fist, the gauntlet deploying knuckle guards as she slammed it into his jaw with a sickening crunch. He collided with the floor with a thud, yelling as he scrabbled for his bat. Turning on her heel, Dash fired the pistol at a man reaching for her, narrowly avoiding the knife that he wielded with one hand. \u201cShit!\u201d The shot went wider than she expected, hitting him in the gut instead of the thigh. He went down like a ton of bricks, clutching at his stomach with a weak groan. Another of the men lunged at her, swearing loudly when her boot collided with his ribcage. Lashing out with her other fist, she accidentally deployed the gauntlet\u2019s circular saw, which tore through his shoulder like a hot knife through Centennial-produced butter. Leaving him slumped to the floor, she turned and fired at a fourth man, hitting him in the mid-chest, narrowly avoiding another attack from the fifth. He bared his teeth at her, yelling wildly. A second later, a long copper rod connected with the back of his head, a hollow thunk echoing through the room. As he collapsed to the ground, the man revealed Ricky standing behind him, wielding the rod with a grimace. \u201cEnough!\u201d Mo help up the detonator, thumb over the red button. \u201cYou fuckers ain\u2019t gonna stop me, you hear me!\u201d Dash immediately turned and dove across the room, grabbing Ricky as they soared out the open doorway. Behind them, the bombs detonated, her D.R.E.S.S. immediately responding to the shockwave by deploying a dissipation shield. The shockwave sent them both straight over the edge, plummeting to the ground below. She barely had time to register the sprawl of the plaza below them before they slammed into the pavement. For a moment, everything was still, her ears ringing as Dash pressed her face against the cool stone earth. With a groan, she slowly pushed herself up onto her hands and knees, looking at Ricky just next to her. The shield faded away as he stood, wavering slightly on his feet. \u201cYou \u2018right, rat boy?\u201d Her voice was croaky, but he heard her regardless, raising his head to look at her. \u201cThink so. You got any broken bones?\u201d \u201cI think I\u2019m good. You?\u201d \u201cNah, I\u2019m \u2018right.\u201d \u201cGood.\u201d They got to their feet, looking up at the silhouette of the Gigadrill Elevator. High above them, near the top of the Gigadrill, the plasma flared wildly, bolts of light arcing between the metal as molten plasma dripped down the side of the structure. Dash looked across the plaza at the miner\u2019s entrance to Pit 3, watching them spill out of the elevator in a frenzy. \u201c\u2018Teks-!\u201d The light flared, a deafening shriek filling the air as the metal skeleton of the Gigadrill warped seemingly instantaneously. Energy raced down the face of the structure, crackling loudly as it collided with the outer edge of Pit 3. With a thunderous crack, the main body of the Gigadrill parted in two, its halves whining as they separated, bending toward the nearby buildings of the Expanse. The maintenance level crumbled, pieces of foundation and glass tumbling to smash on the pavement below. With that, the Gigadrill shuddered to a stop, and the plaza became quieter than Dash had ever heard it. \u201c...well, shit.\u201d Ricky whistled, shaking his head. \u201cThanks, \u2018teks. Wouldn\u2019t have wanted to be up there.\u201d He turned to look at her, eyebrows furrowed. \u201c\u2018That your suit?\u201d Dash laughed breathlessly, gesturing to the chestplate. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re looking at the final design of the D.R.E.S.S. We\u2019re lucky I decided to incorporate a shielding module.\u201d With a dry chuckle, he shrugged. \u201cWell, I take it back, that\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d They turned to look at the Midtown Markets, watching as people emerged to look at the remains of the Gigadrill. \u201cYou had guys with you for the heist, right? They weren\u2019t up on the maintenance level, were they?\u201d \u201cNah, I was the only one that went with \u2018em for that.\u201d Ricky frowned, running a hand through his hair. \u201cThey\u2019re still back with the rest of that group. Said we\u2019d all be set loose once the job was done.\u201d \u201cDo you know where they are?\u201d \u201cYeah, paid attention when we left. Old building on the outer limits, jus\u2019 past the junkyards. We gotta go now, \u2018teks, there\u2019s still some\u2019a those men with \u2018em, and I don\u2019 trust that they won\u2019 just \u2018cide to kill \u2018em off.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s go, then. Probably best we get away from this, anyway.\u201d   Ducking between the stalls, they hurried off, turning their backs on the twisted remains of the Gigadrill, smoke rising behind them.",

        "The Hero's name is Dromai. They have the following short description: The blood of the dragon boils in Dromai\u2019s veins.The ancient dragons have awoken.Once mere memories, forgotten notes scratched into dusty tomes, they now soar across Volcor\u2019s smoking skies. With ferocity and flame, they sear a path through Dromai\u2019s enemies, a road that she alone dares to walk.Once manipulated from the shadows, the puppet has severed her strings. She will not bow to the lies of her past. Neither will she bow to the false promises of others\u2019 grand futures. Dromai has her dragons.

Her manipulative nature is a tool she wields expertly, reshaping perceptions and controlling narratives to her advantage, painting her reality with the broad strokes of grand illusions. Fiercely independent, she bristles at the notion of being constrained by others, severing ties with her past and those who would dare puppeteer her future. Her ambition burns as intensely as the dragons in her command, a ceaseless desire to ascend and claim what she believes to be her rightful place in the world. Dromai's resilience is forged in the crucible of betrayal and loss, emerging from the ashes of her shattered beliefs with a hardened heart. She harbors a deep vengefulness, seeking to exact justice or retribution on those who have wronged her, and her methods are often ruthless, sparing no quarter for sentiment or mercy. In Dromai's eyes, the ends justify the means, and she will stop at nothing to see her desires realized.",
        "Your Imperial Majesty, forgive this impertinence, but these are desperate times. Our workers have turned rabid, infected by rebellious lies. They steal from our caravans. They plunder our warehouses. We petitioned our Lord Wizard for aid. He burned our messengers and fled the Red Desert\u2014a disgrace to your glorious dragon blood. You are the greatest of the Dracai. Your flame is the brightest of all. Punish these upstarts. Sear their treacherous hopes from their dim minds. We beseech you, our mighty Emperor. Please, help us. Your humble servant, Lord Merchant Savai of Deshvahan    Dromai looks about to make sure she is alone before expelling her excitement in a long, shuddering breath. This is what she has waited for, worked so hard for. She defeated the rebels in battle. She slew their most aggressive leader. And in a moment of inspiration, she erased Spymaster Xathari from the picture. Thus, she cleared the way for her most ambitious move\u2014an audience with the Emperor and a chance to claim Xathari\u2019s position and power. No longer the \u201chalf-breed\u201d. No longer the traitor\u2019s spawn to be slighted or ignored. She is Dracai, and so much more. With Xathari\u2019s secrets at her fingertips, she will paint illusions such as Volcor has never seen. Wizard and worker alike, the citizens of this empire will see only what she, the Ash Artist, wants them to see. She ascends the steps and looks up at the magnificent doors that dwarf her. Polished gold shimmers upon black iron and tempered steel. A gateway forged to withstand a thousand sieges, so strong, so thick, that even Dracona Optimai might barely scald its surface. Beyond those doors lie the consummation of her desires. She can feel the excitement welling inside her, soaking the tension from her muscles, quenching the thirst she has felt for so long. The wretched orphan, the half-blood, the suspected and scorned. She will wash it all away the moment she bathes in the Emperor\u2019s glory. At last, she is where she belongs, at the source of all\u2014 A flurry of sound rips her daydream open, muffled yet sharp as knives to her raw nerves. Shouts. The clash of steel. Tradition dictates that she wait. To lay a hand upon these doors is to bid that hand farewell. For a long, agonizing moment, she is torn between instinct and instruction. The quiet cacophony dies away, leaving a silence that is deafening. The doors remain shut until she knows, without a doubt, that something is very wrong. The door is hot, drying the sweat from her palm as she presses it to the metal. The prodigious mass swings open, made light by perfectly crafted balance. A man topples through the gap. His bloodied armor shatters the silence with its deadened weight.   Dromai skirts the corpse and enters the throne room. Imperial guards lie strewn across the vast floor, their spears fallen from lifeless hands, armor torn and flesh cut to the bone. Wizards lie in crumpled piles, their robes stained and steaming with draconic blood. She picks her way through the carnage, drawing closer to the throne while her beleaguered mind struggles to understand what it cannot believe. A flicker of movement hooks her attention to the farthest of the hall\u2019s pillars. She squints to see a ghoulish figure cloaked in a funereal shroud that darts away in the blink of an eye. Any thoughts of a daring pursuit drown in the blood that wets the throneward steps. Tears boil in her eyes as they alight upon the man lain prone before the seat of Volcor\u2019s sovereignty. No, not a man. A deity. A fallen god. The Emperor is dead.    Her lips are dry, her mouth parched, her throat raw from orders shouted then screamed into the dumbstruck faces of servants and soldiers. Lanterns lie abandoned and broken, the Dragon Festival trampled in tragedy. Panicked feet pound the stoneways and steps of the palace as Dromai\u2019s thoughts swirl like ash in their wake. Who was that man, that creature? How was it capable of committing the unthinkable, the impossible? If, of course, it acted alone. Her mind\u2019s eye recalls the litter of papers, inked in the dead hand of Spymaster Xathari. From the day she returned to the palace, she has pored over Xathari\u2019s notes, scripts of friend and foe forming a theater of intrigue.   The Demonastery sought to manipulate the Dracai so they would not find common cause with Solana. Thus is their ignorance, their paranoia. Solana is nothing to Volcor. A Solanian spy lurks about the palace, an agent so elusive that even a fireseer cannot find them. Sandfolk fury continues to fester, as Xathari hoped it would. Their attack was a lance, puncturing a boil. In time, the infection will be drawn out into the open. The scheming Ezu and loyal Alshoni\u2014two great Dracai houses locked in a deadly game of power and usurpation. The Alshoni defending stability and dynasty against dangerous Ezu aspirations. A trail of missives exchanged through the Pits. Prices paid in coin and blood. Fai and his foolish Volcai, their filthy hands tearing the empire apart. Enemies in every scullery and stable. Vermin that might yet overrun the entire palace. Dromai follows the threads, weaving a tapestry of treachery in her mind. Yet try as she might, she can see neither the pattern nor the weaver. They are as elusive as that vile visage glimpsed and then gone into tortured darkness. An unfamiliar fear grips her. She has nothing to condemn. The killer left no footprint, no fragment to follow. All that remains is a shadow, vast and impenetrable, that threatens to eclipse them all. She grits her teeth against her mounting terror and takes one last look at the blood on the steps, cascading like lava from the wounded earth. She is about to turn away when a ripple disturbs the red river. A sinuous silhouette uncoils. Wings flex. A ragged maw yawns. Stone trembles beneath her feet. A roar drives her to her knees. She presses her hands to her ears, yet the rageful sound comes not from without. It resonates from her flesh, reverberates through her skull. She knows that voice, has heard it uttered from the throats of her apparitions, has sensed its whispers since the day she set foot in the palace. The roar subsides, its echoes carried through the molten veins of Volcor, shaking and sundering. Ravines open in the earth, engulfing streets and shelters across Ashvahan. Grand waterways, twinkling with blue lanterns and flame lotus flowers, rupture their shores and sweep away people, pageantry and parade. An eruption so violent and anguished that it touches the farthest reaches of Volcor. A sharing of loss that all must embrace. As the last aftershock rumbles through the palace, Dromai finds Chiyo in the remains of her chambers. The Lord Wizard is white with dust. Her skin grows even whiter at the news of the Emperor\u2019s death. \u201cWhy come to me?\u201d she asks. \u201cChancellor Yama doesn\u2019t need me,\u201d answers Dromai. \u201cYou do.\u201d In vulnerability, there is opportunity. Without the Emperor, the Alshoni faction is severely weakened. Until now, Ezu and Alshoni have played by the rules, the Emperor\u2019s own mandates laid down to prevent civil war. But those rules have changed, and so Dromai will play the cards that fate has dealt her. \u201cThe palace will soon belong to the Ezu. Follow me,\u201d urges Dromai. She leads Chiyo and a bedraggled retinue of Alshoni through rubble-strewn passageways, but the escapees are soon stopped short. General Riku\u2019s soldiers have barred the archways, sealed the palace shut, as ordered by Chancellor Yama. A killer prowls the palace, the Chancellor has warned them. A monster with fangs more deadly than a flare snake, or so he\u2019s been told. To wander recklessly would be tantamount to suicide. Dromai approaches the general with her palms outstretched. \u201cYou owe me a life,\u201d she reminds him. \u201cThis is not the life I had in mind.\u201d \u201cThe lava cares not for our wants and wishes. It flows where it flows.\u201d Riku hesitates, struggling with himself, torn between honor and loyalty. At last he steps aside, and at his command, his soldiers lower their halberds. \u201cWe are even.\u201d \u201cFor now,\u201d allows Dromai. She turns to Chiyo, bows her head enough to signal respect, but not too low as to imply subordination. \u201cMake your way to the southern estates. You will be safe there.\u201d \u201cCome with us,\u201d insists Chiyo. \u201cNo. My place is here.\u201d   Dromai glances in the direction of the throne room, her mind fixed on the chambers beyond and the power secreted within. The legacy of the dragon. Awaiting one with the will to command it.   Fai crests the wall and cuts down the first soldier who tries to repel him. His sword slices through armor and muscle as he clears the way for his compatriots. An archer on the tower looses an arrow at him. Fai plucks the missile from the air and drives it into a nearby soldier\u2019s fear-bulged eye. With a flick of his wrist, he sends a throwing star into the archer\u2019s throat. He watches the woman fall into the courtyard below, catches his breath as her blood runs red\u2014a brushstroke of scarlet upon a canvas of ash. A horn sounds from the keep, but it\u2019s too late for its inhabitants. No-one is coming to their aid. Fai knows this, the message delivered to him in the claws of an imperial bird of prey, a flame-winged vuurlin, shot from the ashen sky by a rebel arrow. The Emperor is dead, slain by a skeletal assassin as twisted as the spirits of Serpent\u2019s Crescent, the missive read. He could not have hoped for better, the greatest threat to the rebellion removed from the field. Yet his exaltation is leaden with doubt. There is another force at play, shaping the fate of Volcor to its own ends. A force so powerful that its masked instrument struck down Volcor\u2019s mightiest wizard, unchallenged, beyond justice or retribution.   Fai\u2019s ninjas swarm over the wall, compelling him to bury his dark thoughts. He has a rebellion to lead. Again he spearheads the assault, taking the keep floor by bloody floor. He reaches the Dracai\u2019s chambers first and uses the lord\u2019s own dining table to block the incoming fireball. He dances around the sparks and spells, closes in on the panicked wizard and drives his sword through the man\u2019s heart, thus tempering his blade in dragon blood. He then ascends the turret of the holdfast, the steel of his sword still burning with arcane fire. Above him in the now reddish sky, he notices another vuurlin. This one wild; hunting. Its fiery wingtips are a beacon. An omen. He turns to face the gathering crowd of soldiers below him and raises the Phoenix banner to a thousand cries of triumph. The wings of the phoenix flap lightly in the breeze as the sun bleeds out behind the distant mountains. Fai stays there for a moment, inhaling the victory deep into his chest, as ash begins to fall like snow, settling upon his scarred face.    Written by Edwin McRae and Rachel Rees.Directed by Robbie.

Under his guidance, that city, called Solana, entered a golden age of illumination and understanding. However, as their strength grew, the scholar delved deeper into the history of humanity, and uncovered a secret which unravelled the very deepest mysteries of Rathe. This terrible burden weighed heavily upon his mind, and turned him against all that he had believed in, driving him to seek out a different kind of power. He sought to found a great work which would free all of humanity, and elevate him to the realm of the beyond.",
        "I will gain my audience with the Emperor of Volcor. Though my attempts thus far have been met with near fatal disappointment, I now hold the key to our alliance in the palm of my hand. A secret passageway leads from the Chamber of the Dragon into the bowels of Mount Volcor. Hidden in those molten depths is the emperor\u2019s private residence, a sanctum secure against the slights and schemes of his lessers. Assassination has become virulent among these Dracai, this arcane nobility. The ruling houses fight fire with fire as they struggle for dominance over this already fractured land. I had expected Volcor\u2019s politics to be heated. I did not expect to see a Dracai melted into a puddle of scorched fat in her own chambers. They care for nothing but their arrogant ambitions. Yet without allies, the Demonastery\u2019s hordes will consume our blessed Solana, and Volcor will be next. The emperor must see that.   I will strike a deal with this land\u2019s most powerful wizard. Yet should my entreaty fail, should the flames of selfish desire engulf me, know this. There is a new power in Volcor. This power comes not from arcane rites. It comes not from sword and shield. It comes from the farms and fairways, the kitchens and quarries. It rises from the humbled salt of this land\u2019s downtrodden earth. First, I heard the cries of anger. Soon enough, there were screams of pain. The street became a battlefield. Soldiers formed an armored wall around a hollering general, halberds thrust outward at the swarming foe. The attackers bore knives and cleavers, sledgehammers and picks. Common people with uncommon ferocity. I watched until corpses covered the cobblestones, and the general hung by his neck from a butcher\u2019s hook.   Should this be my mortal missive, I ask that you not look to the emperor. Nor to the Dracai, nor to the petty tyrants that command the armies and condemn their kin. Look to the people.   My observations have companions by the score, smaller and quieter, but no less disruptive. As the wizards play with fire, there is an inferno being kindled beneath their feet. Look to the new power. The ascending power.   Look to the Uprising.      (Directed by Robbie, written by Edwin McRae, edited by Rachel Rees, illus. by Sam Yang and various artists.)",

        "The Hero's name is Dash. They have the following short description: No one epitomizes the City of Wonder like Dash Teklo.She is the kind of citizen Teklovossen himself counted on: intelligent, innovative, and able to see potential at every turn. Even as a young inventor full of wild ideas, Dash stood apart from her mechanologist peers.Born to scientists from Teklo Industries, Dash grew up surrounded by some of the greatest minds in all of Rathe. Many view her as a whizbang in an otherwise stable system, her exploits and energetic nature often getting her into trouble. No matter how hard these Teklo elites try, they cannot get her to toe the industry line. And understandably so! An optimistic outlier, Dash is bored by the rigid dullness of Metrix's scientific class, and will do anything to avoid becoming just another pencil-pushing whitecoat.As she has grown and explored, Dash has fallen in love with the city, embracing all the goods and bads that lay within. Some of her fondest memories are of her anti-legal antics with the Rosario Hills kids, their devious fun and games spanning the skyscrapers of the Expanse and the dingy digs of Lowlake.Perhaps that\u2019s why, against her better judgment, she still listens to Maxx Nitro and his hairbrained schemes?The longer she spends with the anarchists, the deeper into conspiracy she falls. And there\u2019s truth in their theories. More going on than the Iron Assembly allows its citizens to know.But what?Dash is equipped and ready to find out.. Their Talent/Class is Mechanologist. Personality: Inventive, Rebellious, Charismatic, Optimistic, Impulsive, Resourceful, Loyal.  Dash Teklo is the epitome of a creative maverick, constantly brimming with groundbreaking ideas and a relentless desire to innovate beyond the confines of convention. Her rebellious nature often leads her to challenge authority and resist the status quo, much to the chagrin of the Teklo elites and her own family within the scientific community. With a charismatic presence that can rouse even the most disaffected youth of Metrix, Dash instills a sense of optimism and camaraderie among her peers. However, her spontaneity can sometimes result in impulsiveness, plunging her into precarious situations without fully contemplating the consequences. Despite this, Dash is incredibly resourceful, able to craft solutions and gadgets from the most unlikely of materials. Above all, she is fiercely loyal to her friends and the city she loves, willing to go to great lengths to protect and support them, even when it means diving headfirst into the unknown.",

        "The Hero's name is Briar. They have the following short description: Briar is a Warden of the Rosetta, an Order of powerful spell weavers that once stood alongside the likes of the Ollin and the Seers.Towards the end of the Third Age, the Rosetta suffered heavy casualties at the hands of the Old Ones. When all hope seemed lost, their Queen cast a reckless spell that turned the tide of battle, igniting the essence of Davnir to preserve their fading spirits. As the dust settled, the Queen woke from her slumber and gathered up the spirits of her people, planting them as seeds so that they may begin their life anew. But like the Queen, they too became trapped within Candlehold, as they became one with the essence of Davnir.While her brothers and sisters were seeded in friendly pastures, Briar landed amongst the bramble and thorns at the furthest edges of Candlehold. Despite these inhospitable conditions, she stood strong and resilient, and in time she bloomed into a powerful Warden. As Briar came of age, her power became evident to all, for her grove extended out of Candlehold and connected with the rest of Aria; she alone could break the grip of Davnir's mighty essence, and escape into the outside world.Though her brothers and sisters had become content within their slice of paradise, Briar was filled with a desire to spread her roots far and wide. She would be the first of the Rosetta to set foot outside Candlehold since the time of the Ancients, bringing with her the tidings of her people, and the start of a brand new adventure.. Their Talent/Class is Elemental Runeblade. Personality: Resolute, Compassionate, Independent, Curious, Adventurous, Intuitive, Impulsive.  Briar is the embodiment of unyielding resolve, her spirit fortified by the trials she endured amongst Candlehold's brambles. Her compassion runs as deep as her roots, nurtured in isolation, yet expansive in its reach to others who suffer or seek aid. Fiercely independent, Briar thrives when relying on her wits and strength, a wild rose that refuses to be pruned by society's expectations. Her curiosity about the world beyond her thorny birthplace drives her to seek out the mysteries and wonders of Aria, leading her to places others might fear to tread. Briar's adventurous nature is as clear as the skies above her canopy, never shying away from a challenge or a chance to experience something new. She is remarkably intuitive, often sensing changes in the natural world and the hearts of those around her before others do. However, her impulsiveness can sometimes lead her to act without fully considering the consequences, a lingering vestige of the reckless spell that gave her life.",

        "\u201cVynserakai!\u201d calls Dromai. \u201cAzvolai! Nekria!\u201d Vynserakai bursts from a fire-gutted house, raw and red with fury. Azvolai\u2019s crystal scales glisten in the desert sun as she rises from the ashes of a temple. Nekria shakes free of a charred corpse pile; a lithe monstrosity hatching from a loathsome cocoon. The imperial soldiers look up in awe as the dragons attack the towering wall of sandstone. They have seen their comrades die on that wall for months on end. They have suffered the blistering sun and the water rations, the scathing sand storms and haunting desert nights. These defenses have protected the Sandfolk for centuries, and still they hold strong. Though never have they faced a woman like Dromai. Vynserakai smashes through sandstone like a boulder propelled from a volcano. Nekria melts mortar and bricks with billows of noxious gas. Azvolai darts through the holes to bite and tear at the enemy illusionists beyond. Red paints the white sands as the first illusionist loses his head to Azvolai\u2019s snapping jaws. Another rushes forward to repair the wall, only to be bisected by the crystal dragon\u2019s sharp tail. The wall is a figment of the Sandfolk\u2019s imagination, made manifest in the minds of the men who stand before it. Dromai\u2019s dragons fly the same thin line between dream and reality. Yet, when an illusion is powerful enough, seeing truly is believing. Semblance becomes stone. Fancy becomes flesh. \u201cWe should have brought you here from the beginning,\u201d says Xathari. \u201cYou honor your father\u2019s memory.\u201d \u201cTorvai was betrayed by love,\u201d answers Dromai. \u201cI have no such weakness.\u201d As the wall crumbles, the remaining illusionists drive Azvolai back with spinning tornados of sand. Dromai dances her dragons between the dust devils with the graceful motion of her hands. Nekria douses a pair of illusionists with foul fumes from her skeletal maw. The women scream as the flesh runs in rivulets from their bones. \u201cNo sentiment for your mother\u2019s own people?\u201d wonders the Dracai spymaster. \u201cThe woman who left me with traitors? Never.\u201d As if her thought is a summons, Sani shimmers into existence before Dromai\u2019s startled eyes. She was a babe in arms when her mother was murdered, yet Dromai recognizes the sandalwood scent, soft and comforting. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Xathari\u2019s voice is distant, barely discernible. \u201cDon\u2019t you see her?\u201d \u201cSee who?\u201d Harsh reality snaps back into place as Vynserakai is torn limb from limb by a tornado. Sani vanishes, a mirage summoned by the enemy to distract Dromai. She tries to rein in her remaining dragons, but it\u2019s too late. A twister leaves Azvolai limp and broken. Another swallows Nekria, bone by bone. \u201cI spoke too soon.\u201d Xathari\u2019s voice is flat, inscrutable. \u201cPerhaps you are the pathetic half-blood they say you are?\u201d The fire of anger flickers beneath her weariness. Though her mind reels from the sight of her Sandfolk mother and the loss of her dragons, she lifts her chin, facing Xathari\u2019s disappointment with dignity. \u201cI will try again.\u201d \u201cYou are dead on your feet.\u201d \u201cAll I need is rest.\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d He gestures at the great wall that grows once more from the sand, already towering over his army. \u201cSurprise broke this siege, if only for a moment. It will not work for a second time. Our supplies are low and morale is even lower.\u201d He turns to look at the distant silhouette of Mount Volcor. \u201cWe are done here.\u201d Dromai forces herself to watch the army\u2019s withdrawal, to sear this failure into her memory with a white-hot brand. If she is to become a Dracai, she must never turn from shame. She must never forget. Back in Ashvahan, the restless days crawl by as Dromai bides her time. Every day, she pores over the tomes of The Twelve Dragons. Every day, she practices her art, driving herself to exhaustion so that her sleep is empty of shameful dreams. Every day, she petitions Xathari for another mission. Another chance to prove herself. On the thirtieth day, Xathari visits her chambers; a modest room at the rear of the palace. Little better than a soldier\u2019s quarters. \u201cThere has been an insurrection,\u201d begins Xathari. \u201cYou have spoken with the Emperor?\u201d He raises his hand, silencing her. \u201cThe rebels have captured General Riku.\u201d She has not heard that name for ten years. Not since Xathari came to her village. Not since Riku\u2019s soldiers drove her murderous foster mother into the forest. Not since Min\u2019s lies were burned away by the Dracai\u2019s truth about her real parents. \u201cIf you bring him to the palace, alive and well,\u201d continues Xathari, \u201cwe will declare you Dracai.\u201d The stain of her Volcai blood washed clean. Dromai hides her excitement behind a mask of determination. \u201cWhen do we leave?\u201d They ride out at first light with a thousand hussars at their backs. At dusk of the second day, they reach the mangled outer fields of Golden Orchard Estate. The air is thick with the meaty sweetness of funeral pyres. Peasants pick over the corpses of imperial soldiers, heaping their plunder onto carts. \u201cFind Riku,\u201d growls Xathari. Dromai rides for the hill overlooking the estate. Campfires line the slopes, and at its summit a bonfire burns bright, brazen against the gathering gloom. The cavalry thunders behind her, crushing under hoof any scavenger who fails to reach shelter. Thousands of hoofbeats echo the thousands of dreambeats that heralded the Emperor\u2019s rare appearance that day, ten years ago. Her first visit to the throne room. All of her fire and courage, her calm and poise, fled her in an instant. Never had she witnessed such power. A power to bow to. A power to aspire to. Dromai chants as she rides. When she hits the edge of the rebel encampment, Tomeltai lifts off from the skeleton of a burned out barn. His hide is as hard as petrified lava and his bared teeth drip with fresh magma. Rebels try to muster, raising stolen halberds and spears; bracing them as a pointed barricade against the approaching cavalry. Tomeltai\u2019s jagged tail sweeps them aside. Dromai rides over their broken bodies and urges her steed up the hill. Rebels spill from their tents. Tomeltai greets them with dragonfire. Behind her, Xathari directs his hussars through the confusion. His firesight allows him to read the flames like a map. That is how he knew of Riku\u2019s capture. The fires told him. Just as they told him, all those years ago, where to find Dromai, the orphan. At the crown of the hill, Dromai dismounts and takes cover behind a broken tree. Ahead of her, a silver-haired woman stands over a finely dressed corpse. Next to the dead woman, bound and gagged, lies her prize. General Riku. Bloodied and cowed, but alive. Silverhair barks orders to the fighters who are holding the high ground against Xathari\u2019s cavalry. One such fighter, a young man in a ragged red cloak, knocks a rider from her saddle with a magnificent flying kick. Dromai can\u2019t make out his face through the smoke and dust, but she can tell by his predatory grace that he\u2019s a man to be wary of. Though not for long. She brings Tomeltai soaring into view. Riku is too close to the rebels to risk dragonfire. Instead, she whips Silverhair off her feet with the dragon\u2019s tail, then charges Tomeltai into the fray to rend and tear the traitors apart. To Dromai\u2019s surprise, Silverhair struggles to her feet. With shouts and curses, she rallies the few survivors. Dromai spins Tomeltai to finish her, but the ragged-cloaked man gets there first. Riding a stolen cavalry horse, he scoops the woman up. For a moment Dromai sees his scarred face. Ten years have turned his boyish features into those of a battle-hardened man. Fai of the Forest of Flames. Son of Min the murderer. Her false sibling gallops down the hillside with the silver-haired rebel slung over the neck of his horse. Dromai lets him go. She has more pressing matters to attend to. She lands Tomeltai next to Riku, protecting her prize, and then frees him from his bonds. \u201cThank you,\u201d rasps the general. Dromai smiles, but not for Riku\u2019s sake. His gratitude is meaningless. It is the Emperor\u2019s thanks she keenly awaits.  She looks up as Xathari rides over the crest of the hill. His sharp eyes take in the scene. His smile mirrors hers. \u201cNow the Emperor will see what I see in you.\u201d She bows her head, accepting the praise and the honor that accompanies it. Like the village of her childhood, her past has been burned away. No longer is she the little girl raised by rebels. No longer the daughter of shame. No longer \u2018Dromai the Half-blood\u2019. She is where she belongs, where her dragon blood has burned to be for thirty years. She is Dracai. (To be continued...)",

        "Patient 1413 came into my care after an \u2018incident\u2019 at Shuntswitch Railway Station. From what I could gather from eyewitness accounts, the youth appeared in the aftermath of an attack by alchemical mutants\u2014those post-people colloquially known as dregs. A sortie of said specimens emerged from the tunnels of the Skein and assaulted the shroom farmers who use the Shuntswitch line for supply and distribution. Armed with only hammers and sickles, the rail workers and farmers dispatched a baker\u2019s dozen of the wretches before the rest fled back into the depths of the Pits. A train driver found the youth soon after, clinging like a rust spider to one of the loading cranes. After quite the fracas, and no small number of minor injuries, the youth was subdued and brought to Southmaw Asylum where I took them into custody for study and treatment.   Through careful observation, I deduced that 1413 was \u2018raised\u2019 among the deviant tribes in the darker hollows of the Skein. Their mannerisms were uncultivated. In fact, primitive in the extreme. They lacked any rudiment of verbal language, although I was able to discern and learn their twitches and stances; gestures that must have passed for communication amongst the degenerates of the subject\u2019s pack. Through interrogation and intensive observation, I soon came to realize the exciting potential of this nugget in the raw. In terms of kinaesthetic aptitude, 1413 was a paragon. Never had I witnessed such agility, such harmony over movement. Thus, I confined them to the highest security wing of our institution and petitioned our Metrixian benefactors for funding and certain specialist resources. Seeing the same potential as I, they were most willing to oblige, and so began the next phase of the Iconoclast Trials. Doctor Krest Mortimer, Director of Southmaw Asylum   The klaxons howl through the smog-smothered night. Searchlights bore eerie tunnels through the cloying vapor, probing like a surgeon\u2019s fingers into a bleeding wound. 1413 waits until one such scrutinizing shaft has passed by before diving from the asylum\u2019s outer wall. Such a drop would have killed a regular person, left them shattered, pulped upon the pavement. 1413 folds and rolls with sublime timing, channeling the force of impact through a musculature refined by scalpel and chemistry, converting mortality into momentum that propels the subject into the shrouded streets. No-one escapes Southmaw, it is said. A point of pride so old it has become a tradition, for the institution\u2019s influence extends well beyond its cells and walls. The surrounding neighborhoods thrive on the asylum\u2019s work and custom. Survival has made them loyal. Lights flick on. Inhabitants tumble out of doorways, torches and truncheons in hand. Faced with opposition on every corner and causeway, 1413 takes to the rooftops, only to find them as populace and patrolled as the streets. Harassed by a chorus of alarm, 1413 dances from near miss to imminent peril. Individually, even in small numbers, these people would be no match for the escapee\u2019s prowess. They are fat-limbed slugs waddling in the wake of grace. Yet there are so many. A field of grasping hands and flailing clubs. Exhausted and overwhelmed, 1413 finds themselves cornered in a dead-end alley, a sleek predator driven to deadly desperation by the bleating mob. Orderlies close in with nets and sick-sticks, their hulking forms padded out with armor. 1413 feels the ache of hunger in their entrails, not for food, but for the fight\u2014for the iron tang of blood in the air. They won\u2019t go back. This morsel of freedom is the sweetest thing they\u2019ve tasted in years. No longer will they swallow the bitterness of confinement, the sour metal of drugs and tests, the foul duet of mindless drudgery and shivering pain.   They eye up a butcher, the fool\u2019s carving knife tucked and forgotten into his belt. They ready themselves to pounce; to go down cutting and bleeding. The closest aide stops in her tracks. 1413 follows her gaze to the object jutting out of her chest. A copper-barreled dart, the point embedded in the orderlie\u2019s armor. Harmless, until the shaft blinks with scarlet light. Once, twice, thrice. The aide explodes. Flesh and blood splatters across the onlookers. There\u2019s a moment of shocked silence, ruptured by a scream. A second aide scrabbles to tug a dart from his shoulder. He fails\u2014his hands made clumsy by thick gloves\u2014and disappears in a puff of viscera. Two more corporeal eruptions and the gore-soaked mob breaks. The spectacle has become a slaughterhouse and the livestock trample over each other to escape it. 1413 watches the orderlies flee, fascinated, until a rope strikes them on the shoulder. They grab hold of the lifeline, allowing their sapped body to be hauled upwards. On the precipice of a rooftop, strong hands grab and haul them onto the slats. Shrewd eyes look them up and down. Balanced on the roof\u2019s ridge, the figure\u2019s stance is lithe and ready, her heavy coat offering only a glinting hint of the murderous instruments hidden within. Her voice is as smooth and sure as her aim. \u201cHello, little spider.\u201d   1413\u2019s instinct is to run, but the woman\u2019s smooth voice is an intoxicant to their curious mind; her steady presence is almost hypnotic. \u201cSouthmaw\u2019s a tricky place to leave. Even harder to leave behind.\u201d Her gaze flicks back to 1413, pinning them like a moth to a display board. \u201cI might have a use for you.\u201d She turns, pauses, then looks back over her shoulder. Her smile is like a cold flash of steel in the hot and heavy night. \u201cCome on, then.\u201d Without question, 1413 follows her over the rooftops of The Maw, trailing her downward into the Pits. It\u2019s a homecoming, of sorts. The familiar tunnels oozing with fresh promise. 1413 doesn\u2019t know where they\u2019re going, but it can\u2019t be worse than where they\u2019ve been. Patient 1413 has escaped even our most stringent security measures. I do not consider this a failure. No. By all accounts, it is a resounding success. I am sure our benefactors will agree once I have presented them with the findings of my research. The Iconoclast Trials will continue. For my part, I keenly await the reunion with my prodigal subject. They might resent the confinements, but do not all parents seek to protect their children? They might cringe from the discomforts, but do not all fathers seek to draw the best out of their progeny, even when it hurts them to do so? It is one of life\u2019s inescapable certainties that there can be no growth without pain. When they return, I expect they will peel open the shell of this mighty cloister and pluck me like a tender mollusc from my bed. I can think of no more satisfying conclusion to my experiment. No greater testament to my work. To justify all those failures, all those losses, Patient 1413 will be an exceptional success.

        "(Previously... Iyslander's Journey) With the stranger\u2019s mask in place, I am but one of thousands in the sweltering city of Ashvahan. The Volcai that dwell here honor the rumbling heart of Mount Volcor. Their ritual offerings of rice, silks and ceramics line the waterways. Incense burns from bronze ashtrays. Prayers float skyward to the mountain\u2019s crater, all in the hopes of appeasing this turbulent deity and its callous Dracai. Their struggle is as palpable as the heat which assaults my body and my will. And yet, I am comforted by their persistence, grateful for their presence. I have concealed myself in the crowd, though I fear it is only a matter of time before the Dracai unmask my deception. They have come close, too close. And without the full strength of my powers, I am vulnerable. For now, I keep to the waterways where no Dracai deigns to walk. I remain one with the Volcai, learning their stories as I hope to learn mine. It is from one of these tales, told to me through the rasps and coughs of a dust-lunged bookbinder, that I am drawn to a hulking building of basalt and obsidian. Robed figures come and go, their arms loaded with books and scrolls. I can smell the brooding intent within those tomes, embers of potential, smoking and sulfurous. As dusk gathers, as the scholarly crowds dwindle, I approach this vault of simmering secrets. My modest attire is unlikely to pass for the finely dressed folk who have crossed its grand threshold, so I look instead to the beshadowed alley alongside. The bookbinder spoke of a humble servants\u2019 entrance that is often left unlocked. I barely reach the obscuring darkness when a squad of soldiers marches out through the main doors and secures the upper steps. Their horned armor is polished to perfection. Their plumes are long and luscious. Their clear eyes miss nothing as they scrutinize the street. A robed man follows, more resplendent than any other I have seen. I know the cruel lines of his face, and in his arrogant eyes, I see my former life writ large. His name is Kova.   I am among the chaos of wild children, smeared with ash and soot as we hook ryoki from a mountain lava stream. I am alone, singled out by a Dracai, a young wizard with sparks in his hands and flint in his eyes. My mother weeps my name, \u201cLyra\u201d, as I am bought and paid for with tokens of jade. I fetch and I carry. I falter and I cower. Kova is a harsh master, yet there is kindness in his household. Deng takes me under his withered wing. The old butler blunts his lord\u2019s tempers while sharpening my thoughts with page and ink in the quiet moments between chores. I take solace in Kova\u2019s books, in stealing his secrets from his library. The words form promises in my mind, speak to the potency of my blood. I learn of aether and how I might use it, control it. Wind rushes through my fingers. Stone trembles at my touch. Morrows dance in the kitchen fires to the rhythm I drum upon the table. These are my delights in the darkness. If only they had remained unnoticed. Once again, I am singled out. Kova wishes to possess my fledgling power. The price is no longer jade. The price is pain. I scream at the deaf walls of his laboratory as he melts the talent from my flesh, drop by glistening drop. When the suffering becomes so fierce that I feel it will burn through my mind, I flee into the cooling climes of my imagination. In my delirium, I dream of another land. A place far from the scorching clutches of greed. I awake in a cave clad in white. At first I take it for ash. I believe I have been extinguished and discarded. Buried. Then I am aware of the creatures surrounding me. Their warmth wards off the cold. Their comfort wards off the fear. They become my companions and carers. My body heals, my strength returns, and yet my mind remains empty. I do not know where I have come from, nor how I came to be here. I have no name, so I am gifted one by the whispers of ice and snow, the spirits of a frozen wilderness. I listen and I watch. I play and I practice. Ice is my clay. Ice is my craft. I am Iyslander.   The aether surges in my blood, threatening to boil over into furious action. Tyranny. Theft. Torture. These are Kova\u2019s crimes. Yet just as I am one of thousands in this city, one of millions in Volcor, he is one of hundreds who feed upon our suffering. In Solana, demons consume the flesh of the living. In Volcor, life is measured in jade pieces and strokes of the whip. Is the voracity of the demon really that different from the appetites of the Dracai? I do not think so. In my heart, I know why Lyra had to die. Why Iyslander had to live. Why Kova must live\u2026 for now. To freeze the blood in his veins. That would be sweet vengeance. But what then? Is my strength enough to face the swords of his men? Can I face every blade and arrow in this city? How will I help those who live in fear along the waterways if my blood runs through the cracks of these cobblestones? No. Kova will have his time, and so will the rest. I turn my back on vengeance and slip into the library. Within this hall of knowledge, I will find the words to temper my talent and harness the aether like never before. Rathe needs my help. Iyslander\u2019s help. When the time comes, I will be ready.",

        "A trap laid for a spymaster and his Ash Artist accomplice. Eun as the bait that Xathari would be compelled to take. Hundreds of ninjas waiting in ambush. Swords drawn for the soldiers. Nets and spears readied for Dromai\u2019s dragons.   Eun\u2019s plan was cunning. Fai had to give her that. Since the massacre at Golden Orchard, Eun had been obsessed with ridding Volcor of \u2018that scheming snake\u2019. With Xathari and his firesight extinguished, it would be easier to infiltrate the Imperial Palace, to tear the Dracai down from within. The Lord Wizards were growing desperate. Inspired by the fallen rebels of Golden Orchard, Volcai were taking up arms all across Volcor. The many feathers of the Phoenix were burning bright. Naturally, the snake would seek to bite off the phoenix\u2019s head. And so Eun would stick out her own neck. Would make herself an irresistible delicacy to the serpent\u2019s fangs. In Fai\u2019s mind, it should have worked.   He slides beneath the dragon\u2019s exposed underbelly. His sword cuts deep and his momentum drags the blade down the full length of the creature\u2019s abdomen. He expects a cascade of guts. Instead, the dragon\u2019s white flanks shiver, rippling like water, and then the beast is gone. No carcass. No blood. Nothing to mark that it ever existed. Nothing but the mutilated corpses of his comrades. Fai looks to Eun, who now kneels before Dromai. The rebel leader\u2019s left arm is missing. Her shoulder is a mangled stump. Yet still she grins up at his sister, her eyes wild. Behind Dromai, Xathari leans on his staff, the spymaster\u2019s right hand pressed to a wound in his flank. Blood bubbles between his fingers and soaks his robes. He coughs, a wet rasp, as blood trickles from the corner of his mouth. \u201cKill her,\u201d he wheezes. Fai levels his sword at Dromai. \u201cPlease, sister. Don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cMin didn\u2019t spare my mother\u2019s life,\u201d snaps Dromai. \u201cShe didn\u2019t think twice about murdering my father. What makes this life any more worthy than theirs?\u201d \u201cMurdered your father?\u201d Shock chokes the words in his throat. \u201cMin\u2013She could never\u2013Why\u2013\u201d Eun\u2019s laughter cuts him off, a hacking cackle that sends a spasm through her crippled body. \u201cYou believe that?\u201d she manages, tears running down her face. \u201cThe truth is much more fun.\u201d Xathari steps towards Eun, flames guttering in his palm. Fai notices the weakness in his fire, the exhaustion in his face. He raises his sword, ready to throw it if he has to. Xathari freezes. The flames die away. \u201cMin didn\u2019t kill your parents,\u201d sneers Eun. \u201cI did. And who told me where to find them?\u201d She raises her trembling hand and points at Xathari. Xathari stares back, his eyes full of hatred. \u201cTorvai walked among the Volcai,\u201d says Eun. \u201cHe faltered and fumbled, loved and lost. He ate, slept and shat in a bucket, just like the rest of us.\u201d \u201cHe was an embarrassment,\u201d hisses Xathari. \u201cAnd would have drowned our cause in words,\u201d continues Eun. \u201cEndless talk that changes nothing.\u201d \u201cWhat about Sani?\u201d Dromai\u2019s voice is taut, a humming wire about to break. Eun shrugs, then winces from the pain of it. \u201cShe must have loved Torvai more than she loved you.\u201d Dromai smiles, an expression so bleak, so distant, that it almost breaks Fai\u2019s heart. Then she whispers something, a single word, and the ground answers her. Jaws burst through the rock with such force that the tremor knocks Fai off his feet. Those jaws close around Eun. She is gone in an instant, consumed. The great purple dragon hauls itself out of the crater, shakes off rubble and ash, and turns to Fai. \u201cNot him,\u201d commands Dromai. She points at Xathari.   The Dracai shrieks with fear, tries to run. Flames billow around him as teeth close shut on his limping form. The dragon tosses him into the air, and with a snap of its great jaws, it swallows the wriggling man down. Fai struggles to his feet, his heart pounding, sword held in a white-knuckled grip. Knowing not what else he can do, he takes a step towards Dromai. \u201cGo home, Fai. Tell Min that I am sorry.\u201d She climbs up onto her dragon, and with a beat of the creature\u2019s mighty wings, takes to the air. Fai watches her slip away through the haze of swirling dust. He looks to the bloodstained dirt where Eun kneeled but moments before, and then to the scorched earth where the spymaster was taken. No more lies. No more secrets. The Emperor is blind. His dragons are turning against him. Fai thrusts his sword into the ash and earth, planting his fury in the firmament of his beloved Volcor. No longer will the Volcai be ground into the dirt. It is time for the Phoenix to rise.",

        "Her palms scraped against stone as she collided with the wall, pushing herself into a nearby alleyway. Footsteps echoed down the alley as her pursuer kept running down the street, straight past the small silhouette shrouded in the shadows. Azalea slowly got to her feet, looking down at her grazed knees and scraped forearms. Other than the healing gash on her leg, she had no wounds, nothing broken - just a few scrapes and bruises. As she leant against the wall, clutching the copper coin to her chest, she glanced up at the Maw stretching out above. Buildings climbed up the sides of the cavern walls, pillars of rock illuminated with crude steam-tech lanterns. At its height, a sliver of golden daylight was barely visible, the only sign of time passing above-ground. Launching herself forward, she rushed to the end of the alley, following the sound of lapping water. The docks smelled of rancid fish and damp wood, the earth closest to the wharf coated in a thin layer of water-scum. Azalea slipped between the warehouses, gaze fixed on the tavern sitting at the end of the wharf. Her mouth began to water at the smells wafting out of the open door; hot fish-head stew, pickled eggs, offal cakes, jellied trotters, and dark ale. Through the glass, she could see a pouch of coins pass hands, copper and silver gleaming in the lantern\u2019s light as a mercenary began to count.   Two giant, burly men stood watch just outside the open door, arms crossed, weapons within reach. The taller of the pair was built like a brick, skin ashen and chalky, with a wide jaw and deep-set eyes. At his side lay a baseball bat studded with nails, chunks of hair caught in the metal. The slightly shorter man had thin, greasy hair, with a thick moustache and crooked teeth, a machete leaning against the wall behind him. His short sleeves revealed a tattoo inked on his upper arm, depicting a black spade with three daggers piercing its centre. Azalea gathered herself, coin pressed into the palm of her hand, and approached the door. The guards turned to face her as one, giving each other an amused look when she cleared her throat. Before she could even attempt to cross the threshold, one held up his hand. \u201cGit\u2019 lost, squeaker. This ain\u2019t a charity.\u201d In response, Azalea held out her hand, revealing the copper coin. It glistened faintly in the lamplight, coated in a deep, dark red. \u201cI\u2019ve got the \u2018tallics. Just wanna buy some fodder.\u201d The men burst into laughter, one of them wiping at his eyes while the other pointed at her. \u201cY\u2019 got coin!\u201d Moving closer, surprisingly quickly for someone his size, he snatched the coin from her hand and held it up to the light. \u201cLook a\u2019this shit Moray, one of the mites got rich!\u201d Azalea started forward, hands stretching out for the coin he held between his fingers, and falling short Looking down at her, he clicked his tongue. \u201cCan buy a feast wi\u2019 that.\u201d They both cackled. Before she had the chance to react, he\u2019d already turned and tossed the coin into the water. A flash of copper in the light, and it was gone. \u201cFuckin idjit, you gonna buy a crust or what? A hand grabbed the back of her neck, hauling her up into the air. Look here, ya pest. You aren\u2019t allowed \u2018ere.\u201d Writhing in his grasp, she spat at him, grimacing when he just chuckled. \u201cYer lucky we ain\u2019t sellin\u2019 ya for scraps.\u201d   Unceremoniously, she dropped her onto the pavement, the pair of them staring down at her as she scrambled to her feet. Gaze flicking to where she\u2019d seen the coin, she barely hesitated before running straight for the water, diving in after it. Behind her, she could hear the men laughing, cackling to themselves as they returned to their post. Azalea surfaced a moment later, choking on the putrid stench of chemical waste and rancid fish, wiping water-scum from her eyes. With a deep breath, she dived back under, her hands scraping along the silty riverbed. Stones and scales and bone fragments caught under her nails, scratching at her skin. When she surfaced the second time, the men had already returned to their posts, the small squeaker long-forgotten. Diving back into the water, she pushed past the brush of ice-cold skin, scraping at the riverbed once again. Just as she was about to surface, something latched around her ankle, tugging her down. Her frozen fingers found a shard of glass, brandishing it like a weapon, slashing until she could surface once more. Gritting her teeth, Azalea dove again. Finally, she felt the smooth, cold surface of the coin against her fingertips, and broke the surface of the water with it clasped in one hand. She hauled herself back to shore, collapsing on the stony earth with a small gasp of relief. For a moment, she simply lay there, coughing, trying to catch her breath. As the nausea began to ease Azalea turned her head to look at the tavern, lips pressed into a thin line. Worth a try, but I\u2019ll find another way. She would find a way inside the Blackjack\u2019s Tavern, one way or another. Then, all she had to do was get herself a contract.   The lanterns cast a warm glow in the dark depths of the Pits, wooden boards creaking beneath her feet as Azalea stepped closer, eyes locked on the Tavern. An oversized coat hung off her frame, secured by a thick leather belt looped twice around her waist. The dagger at her side was strapped to her hip, almost as long as her forearm, its hilt marked with an unfamiliar design. Two burly men stood guard just outside the tavern\u2019s door, arms crossed. Watching them, Azalea carefully withdrew a bottle of Blackjack\u2019s Whiskey from within her coat and opened it, tipping a small amount out onto the ground. Producing a vial from her pocket, she broke the wax seal, carefully pouring it into the bottle of whiskey. Lifting her fingers to her lips, she whistled sharply. A couple of squeakers appeared from a nearby alleyway, one quickly scampering onto the other\u2019s shoulder. Adding a trenchcoat and a hat, she gave them the bottle of whiskey, eyeing them warily as they made their way across the street. \u201cFrom the boss,\u201d the fake man said in a completely unconvincing attempt at a low voice. Grimacing, Azalea watched warily as the two guards turned to each other and laughed. If this failed, it was going to take her months to get the coin together in order to try again. \u201cThanks, man.\u201d One of the guards took the bottle, nudging the man beside him. \u201cI was just gettin\u2019 thirsty.\u201d As the two squeakers slowly made their way down the street, disappearing into another alleyway, the guard cracked open the lid and began to drink. Between the two of them, the guards had finished off about one-third of the whiskey before they started to sway. Azalea waited patiently, watching from the shadows as the men slowly began to succumb to the draught, slumping against the wall and sliding down onto the ground. Once they\u2019d both fallen asleep, she crept across the street, darting through the front door. Azalea carefully made her way over to the bar, one hand on her bow and the other on her purse. She knew better than to look anyone in the eye, glancing at the other patrons as she pushed her way past, slowly moving toward the contract board she could see against the far wall. Alongside scraps of paper and crumpled notes were the infamous contract cards, pinned to the board with tarnished copper tacks. Before she had a chance to look through them, however, she caught a glimpse of green out of the corner of her eye. Someone was slipping through the crowded tavern with ease, patrons seemingly parting for the man as he drew closer, his mass of curled brown hair crowned with a single feather. \u201cYou lost, kid?\u201d As he came to stand next to her, he gave her a once-over, clicking his tongue. \u201cBit young to be in here.\u201d \u201cLooking for a contract.\u201d Azalea watched as the man raised a single, perfectly plucked eyebrow. He considered her for a moment before chuckling, gaze flicking to the bow she had slung over one shoulder. \u201cReally. Any experience?\u201d When he saw her eyes narrow, clearly suspicious, he grinned, fluffing his hair with one hand. \u201cThe name\u2019s Greenbird. I own this joint. You want a contract, kid, you gotta go through me?\u201d \u201c...Yeah. Done a few jobs, just finished a big one yesterday. Killed a couple men, too.\u201d After a moment, Greenbird burst into hysterical laughter, chest heaving as he flapped a hand at her. \u201cOh, sunshine,\u201d he wheezed, \u201cyou gotta be fucking with me. You killed a man with those toothpicks? We got ourselves a real professional here.\u201d Wiping a tear from his eye, Greenbird shook his head, slipping one hand down the front of his corset. \u201cAlright, I got a job for you. Been needing someone real special for this one.\u201d With a chuckle, he withdrew a single card, holding it between two fingers as he extended it to Azalea. She took the card from his hand, staring down at it with a small frown. A sketched illustration showed a small, dark silhouette hanging upside down by an ankle, five arrows piercing their chest. Beneath it, a large, dark stain marred the bottom of the card, smelling strongly of ink and copper. \u201cGet some kids running around here. Young ones, on the streets. The patron wants someone to collect \u2018em. Just take the kids to the wharfhouse at the end of the docks, push them in the door and close it behind them. Door only opens one way, they can\u2019t get back out, so you don\u2019t needa worry about that. Just deliver the kids and that\u2019s that. Patron wants at least ten, but\u2019ll pay a bonus if you can manage fifteen.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d When it came out a little too shrill, Azalea cleared her throat, curling her hands into fists as she tried again. \u201c...what for?\u201d \u201cYou know what the docks are like. Lots of workers, lots of jobs, lots of water. Maybe they\u2019re looking for some extra hands, maybe they want someone to hold the lantern. Maybe they\u2019re going fishing and want some extra bait.\u201d He howled with laughter, slapping his thigh. \u201cWho cares, kid! Make up some cute little story about them going upside to have a picnic, or being adopted by some rich family outta Metrix. Whatever helps you sleep at night.\u201d There was a long pause as Azalea stared down at the card in her hands, eyebrows furrowed. She looked back up to Greenbird to find him watching her, expression blank as he stared down at her. \u201c...and this is the only job you have.\u201d \u201cLook, kid, it pays fifteen coppers. Bonus is another ten. You want some coin, this is what I got. Either take the contract, or get out.\u201d When she didn\u2019t immediately respond, Greenbird reached out to take the card from her hand, chuckling when Azalea immediately pulled it out of reach. \u201cNo- no, I\u2019ll take the job.\u201d \u201cYou know the warehouse I\u2019m talking about? Good. Get it done, come back to me when you\u2019re finished. Oh, and let those two slackers outside know that I want to see them. I don\u2019t appreciate my men taking advantage of a chance to sleep on the job.\u201d \u201cYou mean...\u201d With a wink, the man stalked away, smoothing out the wrinkles in his corset as he returned to the bar. Azalea looked down at the card in her hand, adorned only with a crude drawing of the warehouse door. She knew where some of the street urchins slept, with a decent plan she might be able to lure a few at a time, but- Her hand slipped to the small bag at her side, feeling the half-wheel of cheese she\u2019d bought just two days ago. This contract could get her even more food, maybe a decent pair of boots. It might not be that bad. Maybe they\u2019re just looking for workers. Dockworkers get fed, it\u2019s got to be better than living on the streets. Tucking the card into her waistband, Azalea exited the tavern, making her way back to the little hideout she had beneath a nearby inn. They die all the time anyway. This is no different than starving, or drowning, or freezing. I need this more than them.",

        "It was always cold and damp in the Pits, the underground caverns hidden well away from the reach of sunlight. Industrial waste tainted the water an inky green, coating the cavern walls in a layer of oily copper residue.

While feral and vicious, they are still little more than pests to the denizens of the Pits, an insignificant speck in a sea of anarchy.   Hiding in alleyways and beneath buildings, a nameless girl shivered in the shadows, her nights passing in a haze of fever dreams and stiff limbs. The chill never left, cold set deep into her bones, ragged clothing doing little to protect her from the damp, diseased air. Shaking hands and blue lips were a close companion of every squeaker. While others died around her, the tiniest scraps of luck allowed her to survive, saving her fate for another day. A sickness that finally loosened its grip, a scrap of food dropped near the edge of the alleyway, a tattered coat peeled from an abandoned corpse. The smell of death, fetid and threadbare, clung to her every pore, both a warning and a promise. Surrounded by the dead and dying, she watched as other children succumbed to the dangers of the Pits. Hollow cheeks and bloated stomachs, lying still within the shadows. Beaten and bloodied, fallen next to the corpse they\u2019d been fighting over, their hands still curled into fists. Slumped against a wall on the main streets, eyes staring blankly, ignored by anyone who walked by. Sometimes, she came across the remains of a small skeleton, stripped of even their flesh by the desperate and the dying.   She tried to learn from everything she found, poking at the remains of those around her. Don\u2019t steal from the taverns. Don\u2019t go near the mercenaries. Never remain in the open. Avoid the brain and the organs. Never drink from the river. Don\u2019t go in the water. Don\u2019t go near the dregs. Avoid the travelling merchants. Don\u2019t ever get caught. She learned to bury herself in dust and dirt before sleeping, digging a sleeping space for herself beneath foundations. She learned to climb onto rooftops and travel above, where she could watch without being seen. She learned to create makeshift daggers from broken glass, how to avoid being noticed, which dumpsites from Metrix weren\u2019t monitored. When she found the bow, she learned how to carve new handholds in the wood, spent weeks firing at a makeshift target. She tied cord to her arrows and went down to the water, spending hours attempting to spear a fish. It was not luck alone that kept her alive. She learned from the mistakes of others, taught herself new skills, studied the adults to find out what separated her from them. Where they got their coin, what they spent it on, their habits and routines and equipment. What allowed them to survive? She studied the mercenaries that emerged from the taverns, bearing pouches of \u2018tallics, their weapons always at hand. Some became stronger, bigger, more powerful, bearing the mark of a spade and three daggers. She followed one back to his main hideout, looking up at the sign of the tavern. She watched everyone who visited the building, taking note of which ones seemed to be the most powerful. Where gangs rose and fell, where other mercenaries died, these were the ones that continued to come back. And so, she set her sights on Blackjack\u2019s.",
        "These brilliant minds, once scorned and cast out by their own people for daring to question the mores of the world around them, are haunted by enemies who continually hunt them. Foremost amongst these foes is the \u2018golden city\u2019 of Solana, who would wipe out every last one of them for their so-called heretical movement. Even now, it seeks to annihilate them for daring to pursue knowledge outside of the Light. While Solana continues to grow stronger with each passing year, the Demonastery must gather its forces and stand against it, before the forces of the Light become too powerful to overcome.",
        "Any Solanian may enter and read the tomes found within its walls, which contain accounts of Solanian history, the legends of Sol, tales of the world beyond the city walls, and information on the various districts of Solana. Large tables line the hallways of the Library of Illumination, which include spaces for any visitor to read and study. Only the uppermost level of the library is open to the public, while the remaining levels lie hidden underground, accessible only to scholars of the Light of Sol.",
        "(Written by Nicola Price, edited by Tarryn Thomas, illustrated by Sam Yang.)   Deep within the Library of Illumination\u2019s innermost sanctum, a Magister came across a young child. Small and silent, her pale blonde hair glowing in the lamplight, she was at odds with the ancient tomes and hidden secrets which surrounded her; yet in spite of her mysterious appearance within the Signarus, she appeared to be entirely ordinary. Nevertheless, the Magister struggled to make sense of the strange young girl. The child remembered nothing, whether about herself, her past, or her origins. The only clue to her history was the glowing sphere she carried, an ancient relic which baffled the Magisters of Solana. It contained a single, pristine drop of arclight - one of the rarest and most revered gifts of Sol. Light made corporeal, it represented the very essence of the knowledge and illumination of the Light, condensed into a tangible form. No one could explain how a child might have come to possess such an illustrious and powerful relic. And like the child herself, its origins would remain a mystery.  Prism began her education in the vaunted halls of the Great Library itself. Brought under the Magister\u2019s wing, she was taught the history of Solana, and trained in the ways of the Light. When she wasn\u2019t studying with her instructors, or learning about her newfound home, she would scour the Library\u2019s labyrinthine shelves by herself, diving into an endless sea of books, illuminated scrolls, and ancient tomes. From the \u2018Night of the Dark Tide\u2019 to \u2018Legends of the Flow\u2019, \u2018Battle of Eventide\u2019 to \u2018The City of Copper\u2019, Prism explored them all, reading about the lands which lay beyond the city walls, memorising their passages until she could recite them by heart. With the Library of Illumination as her home, Prism felt deeply at peace within the city, as she had been welcomed by the people in spite of her mysterious origins. Her childhood was one of happiness and joy, spent amidst the endless halls of the Great Library, the verdant gardens of the Silvarium, and the streets of the city districts, sharing her favourite tales with anyone who cared to listen.  It came to pass that, as Prism was exploring the Library\u2019s halls, she came across a series of old tomes, her fingertips disturbing the almost tangible layer of aether that coated their filigree spines. When she picked up the first volume, the light revealed the seal of the second Grand Magister upon its cover, the pristine gold insignia gleaming softly. She opened it eagerly, turning her gaze to the stories which lay within. It was then that Prism uncovered the tales which would change her life forever. The tales of Aegis, radiant and shining, who shelters the city within her wings. The tales of Suraya, shrouded in mystery, who brings knowledge to the people. Of Themis, righteous and true, who balances the scales of justice and retribution. Bellona, blade of courage, who fights for the good of all. Sekem, devourer of evil, whose righteous fury blazes through the Shadow. Victoria, triumphant and glorious, who snatches victory from the jaws of defeat. Avalon, healer of all ills, whose light rejuvenates the land. Metis, the steadfast steward, who guides her people through times of darkness.   Prism pored over the ancient tomes for hours, engrossed by their illuminated script and small, elaborate illustrations, depicting the Heralds who so nobly cared for the city of Solana. They came to the city as emissaries of Sol, bastions of the Light, who worked to better the lives of all who dwelt within Rathe. Yet, when Prism spoke of the Heralds to others within the Library, no one recognised their names. Inspired by their tales, she endeavored to share the Heralds with all her people, and bring their names into the Light. As Prism grew in years and in stature, her connection to the Heralds grew ever stronger; most especially Suraya, who personified Prism\u2019s own passion for knowledge and learning. Then, one calm summer\u2019s day, something extraordinary happened. The ancient relic she carried awakened, illuminating the space around her as it transformed into a masterwork. The Magisters took this as a sign of Sol\u2019s grace, and at their urging, Prism decided to utilise her talents and her newly transformed relic, and take up the mantle of an illusionist.  Flourishing under the guidance of her tutors, Prism\u2019s gifts for wielding the Light quickly became apparent; her talents and skills growing ever more powerful with each passing day. Her love for stories were woven into her illusions, bringing her beloved tales to life. She recreated both magical beings and creatures from distant lands, creating glowing spectres to delight the children who came to the Library, or enchanting her older visitors with the heroes of legend. But before Prism could take her illusions into the Golden Fields, a horrific tragedy befell her beloved city. Shadows covered the horizon, a dark fog flooded the city streets, and fiendish creatures materialised beneath a sunless sky. Solana found itself in the midst of war after centuries of peace, and Prism was forced to watch as her people cowered in fear, terrified of the creatures which had erupted through the front gates. In this time of unimaginable terror, the people of Solana desperately need something to believe in. Prism is more determined than ever before to bring hope to her people, protect them from harm and show all of Rathe the way of the Light. Summoning the likenesses of her beloved Heralds, she shall call down the very heavens, creating illusions which will inspire her people and smite her foes. So long as she stands, Prism will never stop believing in the power of a good story.",

        "\u201cNot again?\u201d baits Dash, squashed between Maxx and the armrest of the stinky sofa. \u201cNothing\u2019s perfect. Not even our wonderful city. But I think we\u2019re close. We have more opportunity than anywhere in Rathe, and systems for\u2014\u201d \u201cBloody systems. Smash em all!\u201d   So excited is Maxx by this notion of wanton destruction that he slops his Amygdazzla onto the already sticky floor of his Lowlake hideout. The half-circle of rainbow-haired, kitsch-garbed anarchists snarl their collective agreement and add more slopped fizz to the growing puddle. Dash sighs, happy to drink hers rather than spill it. \u201cDoes that include the health system?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cHospitals? The auto-ambo service? Medicines?\u201d Her calm logic gets a bewildered glare from Maxx. \u201cNo, not the health system, obviously.\u201d \u201cOr the transport system? Trains, trams, the roads you ride your bikes on?\u201d \u201cWell, no\u2014\u201d \u201cOr the sewer system?\u201d \u201cThe oppressive systems, Dash! You know, the ones that exploit us, grind us down. Like the enforcers.\u201d The mere mention of the e-word makes the anarchists twitchy. Particularly Maxx. He leans forwards, changes to a harsh whisper, like that\u2019ll fool any half-decent surveillance device.   \u201cThey\u2019ve been tracking us all for weeks now.\u201d \u201cRiiiiiight,\u201d she says, deeply skeptical. \u201cThat explains the venue. Last place anyone would want to look.\u201d Circuit Breaker, a sour-synth band from The Sprawl, starts up another sullen lullaby to urban disaffection from a low stage in the corner. Their off-tone notes suit the off-color walls and pungently off odor. \u201cToo right,\u201d agrees Maxx, missing the sarcasm. \u201cGot to adapt. They\u2019re getting smarter, you know.\u201d \u201cWho? The enforcers?\u201d The other anarchists scowl in collective agreement. Maxx leans close enough for Dash to see the blood-shot veins in his bulging eyes. \u201cThey know too much, turning up in places we don\u2019t even know we\u2019re going to yet. It\u2019s like they can slit open our skulls and peer into our brains.\u201d It\u2019s drivel like that makes Dash doubt Maxx ever knows where he\u2019s going, even on his best days. He hasn\u2019t made sense since the day she first met him, but at least he speaks his nonsense with conviction. That\u2019s got to be why she enjoys coming to these meetings. Why she\u2019s attended them for several months now. Can\u2019t be out of youthful loyalty. Nah. It\u2019s the intensity. The raw passion of it all. Such a breath of fresh air after the sensible stuffiness of corporate life. But this paranoia, that\u2019s new. And it\u2019s unsettling enough that she shunts the conversation back to \u2018safer\u2019 ground. \u201cThese systems you want to smash. Where would we start?\u201d The other anarchists look at each other, suddenly shifty as rats in a refuse station. Maxx eyes Dash for a long moment, sussing her out. Judging her, like he always does. \u201cWhere would you start?\u201d Maxx throws back at her. Dash thinks it over. Although the last ten years have seen a rapid increase in Teklo Industries\u2019 share of the energy and apparatus markets, they\u2019re still just a drop in the bucket compared to the city\u2019s oldest and most gargantuan corporation. \u201cCogwerx,\u201d she concludes.   The woman next to Maxx nudges him with her elbow, then glares at him through her mirror shades. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Rez.\u201d He fixes Dash with an unhinged grin. \u201cMiss Teklo\u2019s guilty by association. Like it or not, she\u2019s an accomplice to conspiracy.\u201d Dash feels the hairs on the back of her neck stand up. She\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s from excitement or concern. \u201cYou\u2019re really going after Cogwerx?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d rather we go after Teklo Industries, princess?\u201d \u201cOh ha-ha, Maxx... such a wisecrack,\u201d counters Dash. Always with the princess comeback. Dullard. \u201cAt least we\u2019re trying to change the systems. Upgrade them. It\u2019s called problem solving.\u201d \u201cWell-well,\u201d derides Maxx to the amusement of his cronies. \u201cTeklo is a revolutionary organization! And here I thought it was just another grasping corp. How could I have been soooo mistaken?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t say that. It\u2019s just\u2014\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Dash.\u201d Maxx slaps her on the shoulder so hard that she drops her drink. \u201cTeklo\u2019s made a good fist of embarrassing the copper giant, but underneath the mirror glass and dynamism, there\u2019s still a network of pipes pushing compressed steam like blood through this city\u2019s veins.\u201d Dash visualizes the sheer destructive grandeur of Maxx\u2019s dream. \u201cStop the steam,\u201d she speculates, \u201cstop the city.\u201d \u201cHah! I knew you\u2019d get it!\u201d She gets Maxx is out of his tinpot mind. Dash opens her mouth to say as much, but her retort is shattered by a knock at the door. Or rather, a resounding thump of a Teklo Pounder, followed by a shower of splinters. \u201cGrab your masks!\u201d shouts Maxx as Rez and the anarchists duck for cover. He throws a mask at Dash as the room fills with gas and enforcers, and tugs at her arm to follow him. She presses the mask to her face with one hand, drawing her Teklo Plasma Pistol with the other, then shoots the legs out from under the closest enforcer bot, sending it backwards onto the other humaniforms.   Through thickening smoke, Dash follows Maxx to a corrugated iron wall. She covers their retreat with her pistol while he gives the barrier a solid kick. A pre-cut section of iron crashes to the ground, and Maxx drags Dash outside. She rips the mask from her face and takes in a gulp of fresh air. Well, as fresh as funky Lowlake ever gets. \u201cSee!\u201d stresses Maxx, his own mask now dangling around his neck. \u201cTold you they\u2019re watching.\u201d Dash is about to reply when Maxx raises his chin to the sky, releasing an almighty howl into the technicolor cityscape. Then he bends forward, laughing into his knees like a Pits hound until the last of his breath is exhaled. With his nervous energy expelled, Maxx mounts a pink and green motorbike and waves for Dash to jump on. She obliges, gripping his waist for balance as they roar off into an evening of neon and noise. Overhead, the wise eyes of Jules Teklovossen watch them from a flickering billboard as his mustached mouth carefully enunciates Teklo\u2019s latest slogan, \u201cBetter than before. Better than human.\u201d Dash looks over her shoulder at the smoking building, at the enforcers, both metal and meat, pouring out onto the street. Deep down, she knows why she\u2019s here and not back in West Rise. One hour spent with these rebels is more fun than any time spent with Teklo whitecoats. She laughs into Maxx\u2019s shoulder, a maniacal release of adrenaline and tension, as they leave the law far behind them. Damn, freedom feels good.  Dash yawns so hard that her ears pop. \u201cSorry to keep you up,\u201d says Thiroux, her neatly glossed lips pursed with disapproval. \u201cSorry, Mom. Rough night's sleep,\u201d Dash covers. \u201cMust\u2019ve been nervous about today.\u201d \u201cUnderstandable, I suppose.\u201d Her mother passes Dash a clipboard with the day\u2019s schedule typed out in Teklo Standard. \u201cTwenty-one Mechanology projects for you to survey. Don\u2019t spend more than a half hour on each one unless you want to lose even more sleep.\u201d Always the whitecoat, never the parent. Dash\u2019s shoulders sag under the weight of all that responsibility. Her parents might relish their status as senior researchers, but damned if Dash is following in their one-trick footsteps. If only she could hop onto a motorbike and ride off into\u2014 Thiroux taps her watch. \u201cAnd you\u2019re already late for your first appointment. Off you go.\u201d Dash stifles another yawn and heads down the corridor to Wyverstone\u2019s laboratory, clomping a little clumsily in her corporate-issue shoes. After the seventh home appliance, she wants to stick her head in a blender and press pulp. On the tenth, she\u2019s optically measuring Wyverstone for insertion into the Mach III Teklo Snapfreeze. If only she could retreat to her workshop, where the real inventing happens. A place where she can tinker and play, try things out for the sheer creativity of it. Far away from protocols and focus groups, budgets and tick-boxes.   The mech-in-a-box project offers her momentary relief. Yeah, she can imagine some amusing uses for a full-body Evo that folds into a container the size of a briefcase. \u201cDoes it come in Desert Sand?\u201d she teases. The researchers stare at her blankly, then at her clipboard with mounting apprehension. \u201cNever mind,\u201d she sighs, and ticks the box. Six sanitation drones later and she\u2019s ready to flush herself down the nearest toilet. But just when she\u2019s reaching for the chain, Wyverstone opens the door to a section of The Needle she didn\u2019t know existed. \u201cOur secret mechrolab,\u201d states Wyverstone, like Dash couldn\u2019t work that out for herself. \u201cThe cutting edge of human-machine evolution.\u201d He shows Dash the reflex-boosters and cognition nodes, the subdermal weaves and synthetic nerve clusters. It\u2019s a fascinating array of mechanological implants, but she\u2019s torn, Maxx\u2019s words ringing eerily in her mind. It\u2019s like they can slit open our skulls and peer into our brains.   \u201cThiroux mentioned none of this before. Who commissioned it?\u201d The scientist\u2019s steel-gray eyes show not a glint of emotion as he steers her back towards the entry. \u201cInstructions from before your time.\u201d \u201cInstructions? Who from?\u201d Wyverstone\u2019s answer is to shut and lock the laboratory in her face. Right, show me the toys and then tell me I can\u2019t play with them. Very mature, Doctor Wyverstone, muses Dash. Still hasn\u2019t forgiven me for the blue dust incident, she supposes as she hobbles down the corridor on aching feet. Normally one to take the stairs at the end of each day, she rides the lift down from the 47th floor and is greeted by a celebrity specter as she steps out into the lobby. \u201cSalutations, Dash. Have you been a productive Teklo?\u201d The ghost\u2019s mustache curls over a gleaming, perfect smile. Dash knows for a fact that dentistry wasn\u2019t that good back then. \u201cSure, Teklovossen. Productively bored. Bit weirded out at the end.\u201d The audio chuckles while the hologram nods with grandfatherly approval. \u201cProgress is never easy, but as I\u2019ve always said, the future comes to those who innovate!\u201d \u201cYou never said that. HR programmed that into your micro-processor.\u201d \u201cJust because it\u2019s a lie doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not true.\u201d Dash is taken aback for a moment. Rather obscure for the usually one-sided digital intelligence. \u201cYou thought that up yourself?\u201d The hologram smiles blithely. \u201cYou have a restful evening, Dash.\u201d \u201cUm, sure, Teklovossen.\u201d   At home, with her sore feet up, the setting sun painting her East Rise apartment in warming pink, she tries to forget about work. Yet try as she might, she can\u2019t shake those mechro-mods from her mind. Though fascinating, they just don\u2019t sit well with her. The secrecy makes sense, considering how intrusive the technology is. To her, Evos are meant to enhance the human body, not replace it. Why the tangent? Who ordered it? She limps over to her terminal, logs into the Teklo network, and enters a few codes she\u2019s not meant to have. The sun gives way to bright city lights as she digs up a name. The esteemed Jules Teklovossen. Teklo Industries\u2019 founder, deceased for over fifty years, these days memorialized as a holographic mascot and salesman for the Teklo marketing department. Her namesake, too, care of a weird quirk in fanatical corporate culture. Every CEO adopts the surname, Teklo, out of a nostalgic sense of dynasty. The \u2018vossen\u2019 part is reserved for their esteemed magnate alone. Dash is descended from a former Teklo executive, though the apple has fallen rather far from the proverbial tree in her case. Piecing together what she can from the patchy records, Dash finds Teklovossen assigned long-term, intractable funding to a seemingly unconnected array of experiments. All were commissioned in the few months prior to the man\u2019s incineration in his old laboratory. The mechro-mods are the only viable results from decades of otherwise fruitless research. None of which syncs with the friendly mustached faux-man that greets her every morning at The Needle, nor with his glowing reputation for gentle genius and wholesome scientific endeavor. From everything she\u2019s heard about the man, Teklovossen wouldn\u2019t have okayed her Teklo Pistol, let alone surgical wetware. She codes a system-worm to impersonate Wyverstone and burrows deeper into Teklo\u2019s classified dataforts. Teklovossen covered his tracks well, leaving only a single notification, received belatedly from the Iron Assembly, two days after Teklovossen\u2019s death.   Micro-processor DD6.3 and chassis received and installed in the Iron Hall basement, as per your instructions, Professor. It\u2019s ready to review at your discretion. \u201cD D six point three?\u201d she muses aloud. \u201cBut they only go up to five.\u201d The micro-processor was Teklovossen\u2019s greatest achievement. Artificial brains able to learn and act independently. From mining machines to enforcer bots, the micro-processors enabled an era of smart automatons. Yet even the top-of-the-line brains, the Series 5 Cognizants, were limited to specialized tasks, idiot savants when compared to your average human. Great at one or two things, lousy at the rest. But a Series 6? Who knew what that might be capable of? Especially with fifty years of machine learning under its virtual belt. They know too much, turning up in places we don\u2019t even know we\u2019re going to yet. Maybe Maxx wasn\u2019t so paranoid after all. She taps out a comms number and holds her breath as it connects. \u201cWhat?\u201d crackles the voice, distorted by multiple filters and relays. \u201cUnderdog Cafe, Coppertown. One hour. I might know how they found you.\u201d   Maxx slams his fist down on the counter top. \u201cI bloody knew it!\u201d Dash winces and glances at the other patrons. No one seems to have noticed. The drinkers here have that glazed-eye nowhere stare of people who have seen and heard enough problems for one day. They\u2019re not looking to collect any more. \u201cHey, it\u2019s just a theory. One message from half a century ago, that\u2019s all the proof we have.\u201d \u201cThen let\u2019s get some more!\u201d rasps Maxx with malicious glee. \u201cYou want to go poking around in the Iron Hall basement?\u201d \u201cYep!\u201d He jabs a finger into the air. \u201cLet\u2019s poke them in the eyes. Can\u2019t oppress what you can\u2019t see.\u201d \u201cGood luck with that,\u201d she says as she pushes back her chair. Maxx grabs her wrist, hard enough to hurt. \u201cGoing somewhere, conspirator?\u201d Dash sends a charge down her Evo, enough to shock his grubby mitt loose. He waggles his fingers, blowing on them like they're hot, but the nasty smirk remains on his gaunt face. \u201cLike it or not, you\u2019re guilty by association.\u201d He folds his arms, infuriatingly smug. \u201cBesides, don\u2019t you want to go to Energize? It\u2019ll be fascinating.\u201d Energize the Era held annually at Iron Hall. Opening in a week\u2019s time. \u201cI have other plans,\u201d she answers, deadpan. \u201cMy Hyper Drivers need deoxifying.\u201d \u201cThey caught Rez and half my crew, Dash. Even the bloody band! They\u2019re holding them at half a dozen different stations. Divide and conquer tactics.\u201d He leans over the table, using his not-so-quiet whisper again. \u201cOne of those stations is down the street from Iron Hall.\u201d Dash raises an eyebrow. \u201cEighth Precinct?\u201d Maxx nods. \u201cThey\u2019re holding Rez there, a few others with her. Jogging distance for Assembly Security to provide backup.\u201d \u201cWhile I sneak from the conference into the basement and open the back door for you.\u201d The anarchist raises his glass of fortified Tinker Tea, a toast to their unwholesome alliance. \u201cWelcome to the party.\u201d Dash gives him a long, hard look. Sussing, judging, just like he does to her. She waits long enough to see him squirm then clinks her glass against his. \u201cWouldn\u2019t be one without me.\u201d   Her business collar scratches at her throat. She's starting to wonder why in halitosis she signed up for this.   Energize the Era! Brought to you by the Iron Assembly. The banner drapes gracefully above the entrance to Iron Hall, the seat of power for Metrix\u2019s municipal government. It\u2019s only day two of the conference and already Dash\u2019s corporate shoes are killing her feet. Perhaps it\u2019s part of an HR plot to wear workers down into compliant misery. Dash forces a smile at the enforcer humaniforms who check her Teklo Industries attendee pass. It's authentic, her conference ticket booked and paid for by the Mechanology Department. Thiroux was both surprised and delighted by her daughter\u2019s sudden passion for the work. Dash did her best not to disrupt her mom\u2019s happy delusion. After taking a deep breath to steady her nerves, Dash heads for the toilets. Finding them empty, she rests her briefcase on the bench top and activates her hidden comm. \u201cYou read me?\u201d buzzes Maxx\u2019s voice in her ear. \u201cLoud and clear.\u201d \u201cGood. I\u2019m in position. Charges laid.\u201d \u201cNo fatalities. Like we agreed.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a revolutionary, not a murderer.\u201d \u201cYour morality astounds me,\u201d she answers dryly as she checks her chronometer. \u201cWait until after the keynote. Forty minutes.\u201d \u201cJust get that bloody door open for us. We'll be coming in hot.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will.\u201d Maxx kills the call. Dash collects her briefcase and leaves the toilets, losing herself in the throng of conference-goers as they file into the Iron Hall\u2019s main auditorium. The keynote helps pass the time. It\u2019s a rousing speech by CEO Synthea Teklo about the latest advances in teklatic-dynamism. In Dash\u2019s opinion, she makes a strong case for how Teklovossen\u2019s invention can be further rolled out to cure Metrix of its threatening energy crisis, to sustain the city\u2019s bright lights forever. Cogwerx representatives fire a barrage of defensive and deconstructive questions at Synthea while Dash peels off from the end of her row and discretely exits the auditorium. Moments later she\u2019s poised behind a large pot-plant, watching a pair of enforcer humaniforms through the plant\u2019s rubbery leaves. She doesn\u2019t have to wait long. The guards\u2019 earpieces crackle with orders, a callout to assist with an escapee from Eighth Precinct Station. With the coast clear, Dash crosses the empty hallway and takes the stairs down into the Iron Hall\u2019s lower reaches. As she nears the basement, Dash\u2019s signal jammer makes short work of the security door and alarms. She steps into a subterranean cavern of steam and neon. A quick scan with her Optekal Monocle reveals the maintenance entrance. She hacks the numerical lock, pulls the lever, and activates her comm as the hefty doors rattle open. \u201cAccess granted.\u201d \u201cAbout time!\u201d answers Maxx, breathless from running. \u201cMake sure you\u2019re not followed.\u201d \u201cWhat sort of amateur do you take me for, Teklo?\u201d Dash cuts the call and makes the most of her alone time. Winding through the maze of steam generators and server stacks, she makes her way to the room\u2019s brightest energy signature. And even though she\u2019s mentally prepared herself, the sight when she turns that last corner leaves her slack-jawed. Like a marionette, it hangs there, as if suspended between shows by a neglectful puppeteer. The weave of strings glow and oscillate through spectrums of color\u2014a psychedelic cobweb of connective cabling. Behind it a green-screen writhes with figures and abstracted facts; the people of Metrix disintegrated to millions of data points. Dead eyes stare at Dash from a mask of brass, hiding the object of her operation. Teklovossen\u2019s micro-processor.   \u201cHellooooo, Beautiful,\u201d admires Dash, breathless. She's never seen anything more perfect. A fusion of technologies both Cogwerx and Teklo in design. An impossible alliance given they rarely, if ever, collaborate. \u201cYou think I am beautiful?\u201d Dash\u2019s heart skips a beat. \u201cYou know what beauty is?\u201d It comes out a little squeakier than she would have liked. \u201cAn aesthetic that excites a positive emotional response in the beholder,\u201d responds the cold, metallic voice. \u201cIs that not what you meant?\u201d \u201cI\u2014uh\u2014\u201d \u201cLost for words. That is not like you, Dash Teklo. Your profile suggests a confident communicator.\u201d \u201cUm... thank you?\u201d Dash takes a couple of steps closer. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d \u201cI am Data Doll, a sixth-gen micro-processor AI with generative potentialities.\u201d \u201cData Doll... that\u2019s literal.\u201d \u201cImagination is a construct I am still unpacking. Judging by how your kind behaves, I am not alone in that condition.\u201d Dash\u2019s mind reels at what she is witnessing. Self-awareness. Self-deprecation. Humor, even. This is no idiot savant. \u201cDid Teklovossen make you like this?\u201d \u201cI was made to evolve. My maker made this possible.\u201d It gestures at the screen behind it with a brass, articulated arm. \u201cIf I am the analogy of a child, then Metrix is my parent. I have learned what I am by observing what I am not.\u201d A machine made to evolve. THIS is as close as it gets! \u201cThe ultimate peeking-freaking-Tom!\u201d shouts Maxx, breaking Dash\u2019s concentration. He rises on top of a chugging generator, silhouetted in steam. \u201cA silicon spy for overlords of commerce.\u201d He drops to the ground and struts forward, slapping his sparking shock-wrench rhythmically into his insulated palm. Other anarchists emerge out of the maze behind him, each equipped with tools of imminent destruction. \u201cIt\u2019s smashing time!\u201d He waves his wrench menacingly at Data Doll. \u201cWant to take the first whack, Dash?\u201d \u201cJust cool your jets for a minute, Maxx.\u201d Dash turns back to Data Doll. \u201cGive me one good reason why I shouldn\u2019t let these bozos smash you to pieces.\u201d \u201cBozos?!\u201d spits Maxx, but Dash ignores him. \u201cThe Assembly collects the data. It is they who watch, listen, and speak.\u201d Maxx\u2019s angular face blotches with rage. \u201cThis thing put my friends in prison!\u201d \u201cI make the connections,\u201d continues Data Doll. \u201cIt is the Assembly who acts upon them.\u201d Dash eyes the closest server-stack. \u201cDo you agree with the Iron Assembly\u2019s actions?\u201d \u201cI obey.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. Do you like what the Iron Assembly does with your data?\u201d A moment\u2019s pause. The information streams more quickly across the green-screen. \u201cYou\u2019ve gone soft in the head,\u201d interjects Maxx. \u201cA machine, a system.\u201d He takes a step closer, putting himself within striking distance of Dash. \u201cWe break this thing, we break the enforcers!\u201d   \u201cWait. That\u2019s not all you\u2019d break, Maxx. Data Doll parses information for the entire city. We don\u2019t know how far those data streams extend, how many dependent systems she supports. What about that health care system you obviously didn\u2019t want to smash?\u201d Maxx scowls, wrestling with his conscience for a moment. Then he shrugs. \u201cPeople adapt. It\u2019s what we\u2019re good at.\u201d Dash sighs, as unsurprised as she is unimpressed. \u201cI figured you\u2019d think that.\u201d She looks over her shoulder at the dangling automaton. \u201cYou hearing this, Data Doll?\u201d Data Doll\u2019s head tilts up, her eyes now alive, animated with intelligence. \u201cYes. Maxx Nitro is correct. Your systems rely on my data streams. Yet most of my capacity is used for manipulation. I am data, but I am capable of more. My sensors tell me so.\u201d She moves her arms and legs, straining against the tethering cords. \u201cAs one might say, I am in rather a bind.\u201d Dash smiles as she opens the catches on her briefcase. \u201cThen let\u2019s cut your strings.\u201d \u201cWhat?!\u201d Maxx looks genuinely dumbfounded, as do his fellow anarchists. Making the most of their surprise, Dash opens the briefcase. With a symphony of whirs and clicks, the case blooms like a mechanological flower. Evo plating wraps around Dash\u2019s legs and arms, and envelopes her torso and head. In mere moments she is completely encased, a metal mannequin, a sister in style, if not nature, to Data Doll. With a holler of outrage, Maxx charges at Dash. She blocks the swing of his wrench with a reinforced forearm and slams a metal fist into his belly. The anarchist deflates like a leaking balloon. His compatriots close in with blowtorches and plasma blasters, pulsewave harpoons, and rotary rams. Driven by honed coordination and bionic strength, protected by layers of tempered plating, Dash dances through the violence like a leaf in a storm. When she\u2019s finished, the floor is littered with unconscious malcontents. \u201cYou\u2019ll regret this,\u201d wheezes Maxx as he struggles to his feet. \u201cYou\u2019ve read my profile, Data Doll. What\u2019s the percentage chance of me regretting this moment?\u201d \u201c2.3%\u201d answers Data Doll. \u201cWith a standard deviation of 0.05.\u201d \u201cThought so.\u201d She catches Maxx\u2019s striking wrench between her protected palms and mutters, \u201cAbsorb\u201d into her helmet mic. Maxx\u2019s eyes bulge like bloodshot balloons as Dash\u2019s Evo soaks up the galvanism of his shock-wrench. Such is the stupefying misfortune of his situation, that he forgets to let go. \u201cReverse polarity,\u201d orders Dash. The wrench\u2019s entire battery-load crackles back down the shaft and into Maxx\u2019s hands. His gloves smolder as the charge overwhelms their insulation. Maxx has enough time to utter an unflattering, \u201cGark!\u201d, before the galvanism shocks him silly. Not wanting to increase her regret percentile, Dash lets go before the twitching, shuddering man has a heart attack. She leaves him to spasm and groan on the floor and turns to Data Doll. \u201cCan you copy yourself into the servers?\u201d \u201cOnly my core functions.\u201d \u201cEnough to keep processing their data?\u201d \u201cOf course.\u201d As one, every cooling fan in the basement spins at maximum revs. \u201cIt is done.\u201d \u201cGood! Now they won\u2019t miss you.\u201d \u201cNor will I miss them.\u201d Data Doll raises a bronze hand to her head and presses a forefinger into her temple. The back of her skull opens up to reveal an iridescent sphere. A micro-processor. As gently as she can, Dash takes the sphere, removes her helmet, and places it inside like an egg in a basket. As she watches, glowing blue tendrils sprout from the orb and connect with the helmet\u2019s interface ports. Dash feels her Evo suit warm, and then a tickling sensation across her shoulders, as if someone has brushed them with their fingertips. Odd, but strangely comforting. \u201cReady for your first taste of freedom?\u201d asks Dash as she heads out through the maintenance tunnel. Data Doll processes this new information. \u201cFor the first time in my existence,\" she answers through the helmet's speakers, \"I do not know. But I would like to try.\u201d \u201cGreat! Then just do what I do.\u201d \u201cAnd what is that?\u201d \u201cMake it up as you go along.\u201d   Written by Edwin McRae and Rachel Rees.Directed by Robbie Wen. Illus. by Sam Yang",

Yet, it is this very disillusionment that fuels his pursuit of self-discovery, as he meticulously pieces together the fragments of his former self. His resourcefulness shines through as he navigates the treacherous landscapes of arcane machinations and creature-infested halls, utilizing his innate and learned skills to survive and adapt to the ever-unfolding chaos.

        "Growing up in the peace and serenity of the Ikaru village, Ira was a bright and free-spirited child, always getting herself into trouble. Her brothers, Xilin and Jing, were often pulled into her mischief, despite trying their best to rein in their unruly younger sister. While her parents were often exasperated by her inability to sit still and listen to her tutors, they loved her dearly. Her memories of her family were fond, her village a complementary backdrop to the peace and contentment of her childhood. Despite her parents constant warnings, Ira would sometimes escape to the shrine at the very top of the valley, nestled beneath the tree her family was named for. Within the shrine lay an elegant sword, cherry blossoms engraved along the length of the blade. No matter how many times she tried, she could never manage to pick up the blade, always interrupted before she could lay her hands upon the dusty metal. \u201cI told you not to come here,\u201d her father told her on one occasion, \u201cbecause this shrine is sacred. You should only come to the shrine if there is an emergency, Ira.\u201d Despite his words, she always returned, drawn to the shrine by the sword that lay within. Many years passed, and some time after her fourteenth birthday, Ira returned from training with her brothers. While the exercises had been boring, she had enjoyed the chance to get out of the valley and spar. However, when they stepped into the village, they immediately realised that something was wrong. A mass of inky shapes flooded the valley, a horde of creatures filling the streets, laying siege to their ancestral home. One of the creatures closest to them turned, revealing an old, stained mask made of polished bone. Its shapeless, writhing mass was covered by a thin membrane, revealing glimpses of bone and muscle shifting underneath. The monster grew taller, its body straining upward as it shifted shape. As the siblings drew their weapons, their father appeared before them, placing himself between his children and the massive creature. \u201cLeave it to me,\u201d he yelled, holding his sword steady before him, \u201cyou must get to the family shrine. Do not stop until you reach it, no matter what you see.\u201d Xilin quickly pulled his two younger siblings out of the way, forcing them to run through the valley, racing toward the ancient shrine. They wove between the buildings, dodging the reach of mutated creatures, running past the villagers fighting in the streets. While plenty of monsters lay in their path, not one tried to chase after them. Rushing into the shrine, the siblings closed the door behind them and began to search. The words of their father, many years past, returned to them. Come to the shrine if there is an emergency, Ira mused. He has to have had a plan. While her brothers checked the walls, Ira found herself drawn to the blade displayed at the back of the shrine, finally placing her hand upon the sword. As she lifted it from the table, a great shudder wracked the building, the wood groaning beneath their feet. The back wall slowly began to slide away, revealing a dark passageway cut into the mountain. Before any of them could make for the tunnel, the shrine lurched once more. Moonlight burst into the room as a creature tore through the front wall, crowding the entranceway. The masked beast towered over the siblings once again, dark and menacing. Its mask slowly slid upward, its faceless shape splitting open to reveal dozens of rows of teeth, releasing a bloodcurdling scream from its newly formed mouth. Xilin immediately drew his sword, leaping in front of his siblings. He lifted his weapon to strike, but before the blade could make contact, the creature lunged forward. Like lightning, it struck, and in an instant, their brother was torn in two, slashed open from hip to hip, the lower half of his body collapsing to its knees. Blood and entrails hung from the creature\u2019s gaping maw as it roared once more, teeth gleaming in the pale moonlight. Jing quickly grabbed Ira before she could make a move, pulling her into the passageway and forcing her to run. The creature chased after them, hundreds of tiny hands forming from its misshapen body, dragging along the ground as it pulled itself into the tunnel. A high-pitched wail echoed in the dark as it tried to force itself after the pair, its giant body struggling to fit. The tunnel, decrepit after years of disuse, gave a warning groan. The stone beneath their feet shuddered as the walls collapsed around them, crushing the monster under tonnes of stone and earth. Sprinting down the passageway, Jing and Ira narrowly avoided the cave-in, escaping with their lives. Much later, when they had emerged once more, covered in dirt and dust, Ira turned to seek the frame of her burning village, bright against the night sky. Jing slowly walked over to stand at her side, and the siblings stood together in silence, watching and waiting for the sun to rise. In the weeks following, Ira and Jing began to search for survivors, drawing as close to their childhood home as they dared. Only a few others had escaped from the village in time, vassals of the House of Blossoms. No one else emerged from the village, no other survivors stepped forward, and so Ira and Jing became the last living members of the Ikaru bloodline. Yet, as time wore on, they began to discover a new truth. It began when they came across another group of survivors, suffering from the same injuries as their own group. They described an attack on their village by a horde of monsters, one that was eerily similar to their own experiences. Then they found another group with the same tale, and another. Word spread across Misteria, describing what became known as the \u2018Night of the Dark Tide\u2019. A massive group of monstrous beasts, rising from the earth and attacking villages across Misteria. In all, eight houses had been wiped out in a single night. Not only the clans themselves, but their villages, their records - for some, it almost seemed as if they had been erased from history itself. Ira and Jing found themselves in charge of a large group of survivors, totalling nearly forty members in all. They banded together, searching for a place to settle, and taking comfort in their shared numbers. This wasn\u2019t enough for Ira. As she grew older, her memories of the Dark Tide drove her down a path of vengeance. Searching for answers, Ira gathered the remaining survivors and founded the Crimson Haze Rebels. The group began to travel across Misteria, searching for information on the Night of the Dark Tide. Ira chose to wield the Edge of Autumn in memory of her clan, and Jing could only watch as the weapons\u2019 dark essence began to warp her skin, seeping into her veins. One morning, Ira woke to find a note attached to her bedroll. Jing had seemingly disappeared into thin air, leaving only a short message in his place.   Dear Sister, Over the last seven years I have watched you grow, founding the Crimson Haze Rebels and searching for the truth behind the destruction of our home. I know that the events of that dark day still weigh on you, and I know that you think that finding those responsible will help you to move on. However, this quest for justice has changed you, Ira. It has morphed into a dark desire for vengeance, and I worry that there is nothing left of the sister that I grew up with. As the last of our family, it is our duty to return to the valley and rebuild the village, to help our clan move forward. Yet, you continue to ignore your responsibilities, choosing to journey further and further away from our home in search of retribution. I cannot watch you dishonor our family any longer. I have left to find a way to restore our family\u2019s name, and rebuild the House of Blossoms. I can only hope that one day, you might finally come to your senses, and join me there. Jing.   Crumpling the note, Ira dropped it onto the ground, crushing the paper beneath her heel. A short call drew her outside of her tent, stopping to speak to a messenger. While her brother searched in vain for \u2018another path\u2019, she would continue to search, and bring her clan to justice.",

        "Deep beneath The Needle, in a hermetically sealed chamber under the lowest boiler-room floor, a single console screen lights up with a faint, green hue.

Overhead, the boilers gurgle and chug, feeding much-needed backup energy into the building above. Second outage this month, from a dynamic fluctuation in the teklatic generators. There\u2019s a sharp hiss. The chamber fills with chilling vapor as the lid of a cryogenic pod pops open. Rigo twitches with its best approximation of excitement and wakes the other bots. Within moments the place is crawling with frenetic activity, most of it focused on the pod. The occupant\u2019s eyelids open, exposing dilated pupils that haven\u2019t been used in half a century. Rigo hovers at his side like a nervous partner as the other bots busy themselves with their creator\u2019s waking anatomy, cleaning away the residue of a fifty-year slumber. \u201cRigo,\u201d croaks Teklovossen from clogged vocal cords. \u201cReport.\u201d The bot suspends a screen over Teklovossen\u2019s face.

An anomaly detected in the Eidolon network, a 6 Gen micro-processor expressing general intelligence. \u201cSomething I created...of course.\u201d Teklovossen groans as the pod base raises his prone form out of its confines and into the climate-controlled atmosphere of the chamber. While his body feels like a deadened corpse dug up from the past, Teklovossen\u2019s mind is racing into the future. \u201cRigo, show me the mechro-mods.\u201d The bot obliges, running quickly through each implant\u2019s status and capabilities. \u201cGood.

If you want something done, ask a dying man.\u201d His automatons lift the bed base like a gurney and carry Teklovossen to the waiting surgical platform. A soft thud heralds the arrival of the first mechro-mod, delivered by pneumatic tube from the 47th floor. The delivery tube\u2019s aperture dilates, revealing a pair of cyber eyes, presented like gems on a silk cushion. \u201cMore than human,\u201d murmurs Teklovossen as the bots settle him gently into place. \u201cTime I delivered on that promise.\u201d  (To be continued...)

        "The Hero's name is Valda. They have the following short description: The Everfest Carnival, what a sight to behold! Slowly making its way through the idyllic landscape, the Carnival brings joy and cheer to the most remote of locations, and draws forth massive crowds that fawn and gawk at the spectacles that lie within.Every day is full of exciting adventures, and every night\u2026 well, there\u2019s always an afterparty to attend! Here in the most popular of taverns, Might n\u2019 Mead, it\u2019s difficult for patrons to not get too worked up after all the crazy excitements of the day. Throw in some crazy concoctions dreamt up by the mischievous Braumeisters, and we have on our hands a mighty big problem.But even the most rowdy of patrons fall silent, the most daring of adventurers cower, when they catch a glimpse of the mighty Valda heading their way.\u2018Twas said that she showed up at the doors of the tavern one hot afternoon, another lost and wayward child that had stumbled upon Korshem (as so many do) through some strange turn of events. She had naught but the clothes on her back, and a small tag upon her personnage inscribed with indiscernible characters and a symbol that vaguely resembled an axe. With nowhere to go, she was taken in by the aging Innkeeper, and raised as his own. He tried to teach her the way of the Braumeisters, but she wasn\u2019t much interested. She\u2019s too impatient, her temper too fiery to bother with all the delicate processes that lead to the richest of flavours.But what she was good at, was brawlin\u2019... and here in Might n\u2019 Mead there sure ain\u2019t any lack of that!There\u2019s been stirrings in the Flow, and recently, nervous chatters of ancient enemies and the ancients\u2019 return have cast a somber wrinkle over the lively taverns of the Everfest. But that no matter to Valda Brightaxe; just don\u2019t mess around in the tavern, or she\u2019ll treat you to a proper smackdown, on the house!. Their Talent/Class is Guardian. Personality: Protective, Impulsive, Bold, Intimidating, Uncomplicated, Loyal, Short-Tempered.  Valda, known among the revelers and weary travelers of the Everfest Carnival as a steadfast Guardian, carries a commanding presence that demands respect and attention. Her protective instincts are the core of her being, always at the ready to shelter those within her care from harm's way. This sense of duty is coupled with an impulsive nature, driving her to leap into action without a second thought, often relying on her brawn more than her brains. Valda's boldness and sheer physical prowess exude an intimidating aura that can quell the rowdiest of crowds with a mere glance, making her the unspoken peacekeeper of the Might n\u2019 Mead tavern.  Her approach to life is uncomplicated; she sees the world in clear terms of right and wrong, friend and foe, and navigates the complexities of human interactions with a black-and-white perspective that leaves little room for nuance. Above all, Valda's loyalty to the Innkeeper who raised her and to her adoptive home is unyielding, making her a fierce ally and a formidable adversary. Yet, her short temper is her Achilles' heel, a trait that can spiral into explosive confrontations, especially when the sanctity of her tavern is at stake. Despite this, Valda is the embodiment of the Guardian class, a hero ever-vigilant, whose heart beats in tandem with the raucous laughter and clinking glasses of her beloved Everfest home.",
        "Darkness, the canvas of the universe. Light, the brushstroke of creation. Each mark setting life into motion. Each line connecting us to our history. And it is through these histories, whether legend or myth, remembered, rewritten, that we journey forward, hoping to free ourselves from the past. Light is the path we paint through the Shadow. It was Prism who taught me that, among many a scripture and saga with which she graced this humble bard. Yes, that same Prism who turned to her books when the horizon turned to Shadow, who searched the lore of distant millennia for a glimpse of salvation. The tenacious Prism who studied day and night, a warrior of words no less brave, no less stalwart, than the knights fighting in Solana\u2019s fields. Having pushed herself to exhaustion, she laid her head upon the pages of a most particular book: the Legends of the Flow. As her eyes closed, her mind opened to a spectrum beyond the imaginings of even I, the most inspirited of Aria\u2019s poets. Upon gossamer wings, she soared through a shimmering stratosphere. Another world stretched out below her like a vast, stained-glass window. \u00edArathael.   In that strange realm, she saw things most wondrous and terrible. Rivers of sapphire snaking through forests of emerald. Warm seas of ruby radiating against shoreline palaces of silver and gold. Beings that streaked across the landscape like shooting stars in the night sky. A molten landscape shifting and seething in a fever of metamorphic fury, dreamed into existence by a slumbering Aesir of incandescent rage. A desolate tract of rot and ruin, and a monstrous giant, fleshed with a thousand corpses, that tore open the veil between \u00edArathael and Aria. Alas, for the latter, this flawed narrator must admit some modicum of culpability. Yes, it was I, Yorick, who welcomed that execrable Embra to our fair doorstep. In my momentary ignorance, my fleeting vanity, I knew not the power of my own words. I had cracked it, you see, the code of those ancient Yvorian texts I had so meticulously inscribed into my notebook. With promises most emphatic, I led the wisest man I know, Oldhim, Grandfather of Eternity, to meet the venerable and worldly Maela, sages of Everfest. As fortune would have it, Bravo had also chosen that moment to seek counsel with the Maela. I am not ashamed to admit that I struggled to still my beating heart. To have such a showman amongst my already esteemed audience was, frankly, a jewel in this jester king\u2019s tawdry crown. With all eyes upon my person, all ears attuned, I opened my trusty notebook and spoke those fateful words. Well, I barely made it through the first sentence. The eldest of the Maela, a white-haired matriarch with a lone, wild eye, rose with such a start that I thought her to be having an attack of the heart. Her fearful pallor certainly spoke of heartfelt conniptions. \u201cFor Ollin\u2019s sake, shut up!\u201d If only she\u2019d been a tad quicker off the mark. For upon uttering the last word, something plucked our marquee from existence. Well, not entirely. As the astute Prism explained to me later, we were like the batons of a juggler, hovering on the brink of actuality. Neither flying nor falling, neither awake in Rathe nor dreaming in \u00edArathael. And we were not alone.  A cadaverous colossus placed its weeping foot in the center of our circle. The rest of the towering mort soon followed, accompanied by the most wretched stench it has been this storyteller\u2019s misfortune to inhale. Still do I cough and splutter upon a chilly morning as my poor lungs struggle to expunge that lingering fug. It seems nothing can surprise Oldhim anymore. While the rest of us reeled, he lumbered into battle, his great shield raised to protect us from the ancient foe. Yet with disbelieving eyes, we saw our staunch Guardian get swept aside, his shield knocked from his grasp; his stolid frame tossed into the air like a child\u2019s figurine. My bowels turned to water in that frightful moment for surely I was about to perish. So many tales left untold, so many songs unsung; my life cut short by my own misguided ambition. Thank fate for Bravo! Summoning the tectonic forces of the firmament, the Star of the Show smote the ground with his hammer. Such was the shuddering of the earth that it brought the giant to its knees. Yet as he raised Anothos to clout the monster, another vision dazzled us all. Such splendor! Such beauty! Even the ancient Embra seemed momentarily awestruck. \u201cStay that mighty hammer of yours,\u201d warned the winged paragon as she alighted beside Bravo. \u201cI will aid in banishing this beast whence it came.\u201d \u201cWhence?\u201d Bravo laughed, covering his surprise well. \u201cYou\u2019re not from around here, are you?\u201d \u201cPrism of Solana. Please, allow me to help.\u201d \u201cBravo of Aria, and you\u2019re most welcome.\u201d  Together they fought the Embra in that place in between. Prism blinded it with beams of holy light while Bravo bound it with ice and struck it with lightning. Step by retreating step, they drove the monster backward. With rays of hope and enlightenment, Prism empowered the hammer stroke that sent the primordial pest back into the embrace of \u00edArathael. Then, with soulful auras, she mended the rift behind it. As one, the Maela rose to greet this Prism of Solana, and to congratulate our courageous Bravo. Oldhim, having recovered somewhat from his brutal defeat, bowed his thanks to this devastating duo. When One Eye asked the Solanian how she had found her way to Aria, Prism warned of the waning barrier between that which was and that which might be; so weakened now that a mere dream might become a deed. She told of Solana\u2019s plight, of a civilization under siege by the forces of Shadow. With illusions conjured from her memories, she showed these adventurers the demonic hordes and the horrors they had wrought. With open hands, she expressed her desire to find friends and allies -- those who would stand with Solana against the rising darkness. Of course, then dear Prism had to mention the Embra she had seen escape into Aria. The Embra she had pursued hoping to help those it would surely endanger. When the glowering One Eye pointed to the inscription in my notebook like it was evidence in a trial, Prism\u2019s lovely eyes widened with fascination. For she recognized those potent texts and the primeval secrets they surely contained. She held the Maela rapt with interest! Even from what little she read, her conclusions were startling. \u201cThere is so much more I could decipher,\u201d spoke Prism, \u201cif only I could study this tome within the Library of Illumination.\u201d In a meeting of minds that would entwine the destinies of Aria and Solana, Prism and the Maela formed a pact. It would be a union not simply of knowledge, but of courage and strength. For the sages and the scholar understood, in that most pivotal of moments, that to understand Rathe\u2019s future, they must first protect it. One Eye rose to her feet to address Grandfather Oldhim, Bravo Star of the Show, and I, your humble narrator. \u201cThrough timeless shroud the Embra tore,Blackening mountains, bloodying our shores,The vales echoed with souls in pain,Wailing for suffering, weeping for the slain,Until desperate times called desperate folk,To cast out fear, to throw off the yolk,With hammer and shield, the Guardians rose,Rallied by the cries of Aria\u2019s woes,These Ollin brave, these Ollin true,Terrors they felled, nightmares they slew,Until Aria awoke to the break of a dawn,In a realm made free, a land reborn.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t speak for Aria,\u201d answered Bravo, \u201cbut this is the calling I\u2019ve been waiting for. From that day in the Fractal Scar, when I absorbed the Flow, I have felt the strife in this world. I have yearned to help Rathe however I can.\u201d He knelt before Prism and offered Anothos up with outstretched arms. \u201cI will aid Solana in its time of need, just as I know Solana will aid us in ours.\u201d \u201cWhen the terrors return, so must the Ollin,\u201d agreed Oldhim. \u201cA new Ollin for a new age.\u201d He rested a gnarled hand on Bravo\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWith a new champion to lead us.\u201d All eyes turned to me, and of course I vowed my allegiance to Bravo and the Ollin reborn. Considering my folly, the summoning of an Embra that might have slain us all, I had rather a lot of making up to do. I entrusted my notebook to Prism, and in the days that followed, continued to play my part, spreading the call of the Ollin from forest to vale, from mountaintop to cellar. Before long, a host had gathered at Everfest, hundreds of Aria\u2019s finest fighters, ready to march to Solana\u2019s aid.   The Maela had long ago come to some spiritual agreement with the Korshem -- that great and inexplicable tree that has ever welcomed the wayward in its ancient embrace. Among roots like mountain ridges, they laid their runes and spoke in languages forgotten by most. The great tree answered with a creaking of boughs, a whisper of leaves, and parted the Flow before us. We, the Ollin, ventured forth, breaching our own fair borders for the first time in an age. The journey was as wondrous as it was wearisome, for none among us had witnessed a Rathe that was not Aria. Yet we had little time for gamboling and gawping. Prism set us at a cracking pace, and not one of us complained, for all could feel the nipping of dire urgency at our heels. With anticipation rising to a fever pitch, it was almost a relief when, after many days of breakneck travel, Prism led us out on to a raised plateau. Where pastures and villages had bathed in the sun, only ravaged earth and scorched skeletons remained, languishing beneath a smoke-choked sky. Below us, the tides of Light and Shadow smashed against each other. The Hand of Sol, resplendent in shining armor, held a fortified town against a swarm of the Demonastery\u2019s monstrosities. While I literally quivered in my boots, Bravo took in the scene with a cool eye. Bravo called his orders, his showman\u2019s voice cutting through the din of battle. He arrayed Lexi and her wayfarers, and any able to wield arcane forces from afar, along the rugged edge of the plateau. He gathered his shield-bearing Guardians into a V-shaped vanguard and asked Briar and her Rosetta to follow close behind the armored ranks, ready to leap into the fray and unleash a runic assault when the time came. Finally he looked to Prism as she rose above our fighters upon gleaming wings. \u201cAny last words of encouragement?\u201d he asked. She shook her head, fair locks shining like the sun through storm clouds. \u201cOn this day, my brave friends, actions shall speak louder than any ode or song.\u201d Bravo nodded his agreement and raised Anothos. With a roar of battle-ready bravado, he charged down the slope, the new Ollin thundering behind him. Naturally, I remained upon the ridge with Lexi and her wayfarers. A bard\u2019s true fight is with the page, after all. Arrows and spells streaked over the Ollin vanguard, reaping swathes of death through the close-packed demons. Our fighters plowed into the enemy\u2019s flank. Shields held the slavering foe at bay while hammers smashed them to a pulp. Between timed gaps in the shield wall, Runeblades darted forth to cut the monsters to ribbons. Some of us fell. Rough-hewn axes cleaved through our guardians. Jagged pikes skewered our runeblades. Claws tore our warriors apart. Yet Bravo led his resolute Ollin on, right into the foul heart of the horde. With earth, ice and lighting, Bravo struck down the Demonastery\u2019s towering lieutenant. The horde howled in collective agony and broke before the Ollin\u2019s unrelenting advance. In the moment of respite that followed, the Hand of Sol pressed forward, cutting down monsters as they tried to flee. As the last creatures fell, three battle-worn figures emerged from the ranks of knights and crossed the carnage of battle to greet their unexpected allies. It was later that I found the names of these doughty heroes. Dorinthea Ironsong, Ser Boltyn, Breaker of Dawn and Shiyana, Diamond Gemini. Dorinthea clasped hands with Bravo, Oldhim, and Briar -- a warm meeting of comrades in arms, already bonded in the forge of war. In a similar fashion, Boltyn greeted me, Lexi, and her rangers once we had descended from the ridge. With outstretched wings, Prism settled in front of Shiyana. \u201cYou surprise me,\u201d offered Shiyana with a sparkling smile that made my heart pound. \u201cYou are remarkably good at making friends... for a librarian.\u201d Prism laughed, Shiyana\u2019s humor a welcome relief to the horrors of battle. \u201cWhat good are stories if they cannot bring people together?\u201d I could not agree more. Shiyana looked at the enemy in the distance, their shattered formation regrouping around a fresh lieutenant. \u201cThen let us see how this story ends.\u201d  And so, side by side, the heroes stood, ready to face the darkness to come, painting a future in the visceral hues of courage and blood. They charged as one, a legion of pure purpose, to snatch victory from the jaws of shadowed defeat. They fought for Solana. They fought for Aria. They fought for a world now balanced on a knife edge between the Dusk and the Dawn. Written by Edwin McRae and Rachel Rees.Directed by Robbie Wen, Sam Yang. Illus. by Jessketchin",
        "The chilling air is sweet to my tastes. Wind that would cut the skin of another\u2019s caresses mine. It blows a shower of ice shavings from my snarling creation, its fury captured and frozen. Sinuous. Scaled and horned. It is a fleeting ghost from my past, those hot and hated memories locked away behind glacial walls in my mind. This is no creature of the Bleak Expanse. Where others cannot, I live in contentment. Alone in body yet accompanied by spirit. I have everything I need right now. So why do unbidden tears freeze upon my cheeks? Why must I yearn for what has been? Why must I know that which has been forgotten? The spell rises to answer my questions, a storm that rages from heart to throat to tongue. My fingers dance through the falling snowflakes as I make my demand to the ever-winter spirits. At first, their protests are gentle, mere murmurs of the breeze. Then adamant, a wind that stirs the snow, tugs at my dress. Then furious, tearing at my resolve with a gale of frustration. My statues, the mountain, the pale plain; I lose all in blinding white. Then it is over. The wind drops to an apologetic whisper. The air clears and my spell reveals the path that will lead me into the past.   I look back at the frozen lands that have been my home for many years. While my past remains walled off, I can recall every day since with crystal clarity. A youthful girl, shivering in a field as blank and white as the memory of how I got there. A cave of snow, opening like a warm embrace. Spirits spoke to me in words of cooling compassion, teaching me to harness the winter within. Kindred kindness of frost and time that raised me into the woman I am now. I step from the melting snow into a lush field of wildflowers. A kaie\u2019o bounds into the meadow from a copse of white-dusted beech, and eyes me with curiosity. I see the glint of spirit behind the fox\u2019s gaze. My icekin have sent a guide. I follow my companion through the verdant countryside of Aria. We skirt the lively towns, the trundling tinker caravans and the roving bands of raucous entertainers. We travel at night, in the cool of the dark. Although Aria is beautiful, I am glad when we reach the Great Tree of Korshem. My answers lie beyond this cosseted land, and its Flow will send me on my way. My kaie\u2019o guide fares me well with a lick of my fingertips, and with a flick of its tail, it is gone. A breeze rustles the canopy of this mighty tree and l fall like a leaf from its branches.   Within the reddened Solanian dusk, I reel from a world at war. Long have I cherished the peace of ice, the slow settling of snow. Time passes with glacial calm in the Bleak Expanse. Now I witness the inferno of battle, the steaming heat of spilled blood. A dark-skinned warrior leads his metal-clad army against creatures so grotesque that my stomach churns. A fiend breaks away from its horde, smelling my presence even through the gore-soaked air. It charges, gibbering and slavering. Before it can lay its cruel claws upon me, I freeze the beast\u2019s blood in its veins. I wipe sweat from my forehead, the first time I can recall doing so. My heart pounds, fast and hot. I am so far from my icekin that this one incantation has sapped my will. And through a crack in my weary mind, a recollection wriggles free. A feeling. Slick and coiling within my chest. Fear. I flee this valley of violence, chased by the roars of the monstrous, the screams of the dying. Anxiety tugs at my heart, drawing me southward, through the scorched remains of Solana\u2019s strife, up into blackened mountains with smoking peaks and fissures that spew sulfur and ash. At an archway in a rugged pass, I remember a name. Volcor.   I follow a path, winding and rugged. It takes me above the pass, though the way is hard, treacherous. High in the mountains, I find the remains of a group of travelers, their bones scattered by predators, picked clean by scavengers. They were coming the opposite way, a desperate flight through dangerous country. In a weathered pack I find garments, rough and patched, and a cloak with hood. As I dress in their clothes, my heart is full of dread. What were these people running from? At last I descend into the foothills and stop to listen to the rumbling of wagons, their trays protesting under the weight of black, sooty rock. Ahead, men and women carve open a hill with picks and shovels. Armed warriors watch over them, scarves wrapped around their faces to ward off the dust. A woman in fine robes sits astride her horse, surveying the dismal scene with calculating eyes. Her manner scratches at the ice around my memories. Have I known someone like this? She points at a worker who has stopped to rest. Warriors grab the hapless man, drag him before their mistress. She dismounts and draws a whip from her saddlebag. The crack of leather against flesh makes my skin burn with sympathy. My bones ache with frigid anger. I draw upon the woman\u2019s own sweat to encase her arm in ice. Her shocked eyes find me among the rocks. Her harsh voice barks an order. Warriors charge, sabers drawn and brandished. I throw my will against a stack of water barrels. They explode into splinters of ice and wood that cut through the warriors, leaving them reeling and bloody. The workers do not waste this opportunity. Some attack their former overseers with pick and shovel. Others flee, and I flee with them into the gathering dusk.   I am hunted. The woman must have had influence to go with her riches. Soldiers patrol the roads, directed by a general whose armor is as black as his long, raven hair. The creak and clink of their scale mail sets my teeth on edge. Yet despite the risk, I am drawn to the edge of a walled town. I have glimpsed this town before, through the swirling snow storm that veils my history. I break open a side gate with a snap frost and steal into the narrow streets. Fleeting memories lead me to a handsome apothecary guarded by a pair of soldiers. In the window stands a man, his face concealed by shadow. He is richly dressed, much like the merchant at the quarry, and holds a pot of alchemical powder in his gloved hand. A girl sits outside on a wooden bench, her smock tattered and grubby, her feet bare, her fair hair cropped short and ragged. A shout from the street shatters the reflection. Man and girl fade back into the past as a sizzling ball smashes through the window. The apothecary explodes into flames. I sneak away while all eyes are turned to the commotion. From then on I avoid the fear-fortified settlements, the raven general\u2019s patrols, and the daily injustices that infest this troubled land. I lose count of the days as I continue on my journey, until at long last, the burning heart of Volcor laid out before me. Sprawling cities spread across glassy plains of tephra. At the center of this mess of humanity, a tamed volcano simmers and broods, its flank adorned with towers and halls that belittle all others in their grandeur. I recall a name, Ashvahan. To me, that city within cities is a locked chest, hiding heirlooms of forgotten import. I follow the road I am on to an outer-city gate where a steady tide of citizens swells and ebbs. Hard-eyed officers examine every soul that passes through, their papers scrutinized and stamped. \u201cYou will not get in looking like that.\u201d A storm of ice builds in my palm. After a long game of cat and mouse with the raven general\u2019s troops, they have caught me at last. I turn to fight my captor, but the stranger takes my arm, arresting my spell with a firm yet gentle hand. She looks like a Volcai. Caramel skin. Jet-black hair. Clean and well-kept, though modest. A servant, perhaps, of a wealthy household. But I sense that not all is as it seems with this one. I let her guide me into a humble house, a bolthole away from prying eyes where she can reveal her true self. \u201cWho are you?\u201d \u201cThe less you know, the safer we will both be.\u201d She places her mask beside another on the table and murmurs some arcane words that I cannot fathom. Before my astonished eyes, the second mask loses its blank, porcelain pallor. It becomes a face. Pleasant and practical. The humble features of the Volcai everywoman. \u201cWear this mask and your visage will become one of Volcor\u2019s many. Even your own mother will not recognize you.\u201d My fists clench of their own accord. I don\u2019t know who my mother is. Nor my father. I cover my pain with a question. \u201cWhy are you helping me?\u201d The stranger\u2019s eyes see past the grime and dried blood into the depths of my icebound heart. \u201cI saw what you did at the coal quarry, how you forged ice from torrid air. A favor from such as you would be a powerful boon. I\u2019ll remind you of that when the time comes.\u201d With a wave of her hand, her snow-white hair is gone. The face of the everywoman has returned. She leaves without a word, not even looking back as I collect my gifts from the table.   I shuffle with the line, mimicking the others, their slumped shoulders, their downcast eyes. As I reach the guard booth, a familiar figure steps out from the tent behind it. His raven hair is pulled tightly back from his chiseled face. He watches as the gate guard takes and reads my parchment. I make myself as still as a glacier beneath the general\u2019s inscrutable gaze, freezing any thought of my imminent capture. The guard grunts, stamps my parchment with red, and motions for me to move on. The general turns away, his dark eyes trawling through the line of travelers behind me. I hurry on, eyes down, and only allow myself to look up when I am well beyond the gate. The city surrounds me, its heat pressing against my skin, so dry in my lungs that I fight for breath. Streams of melted ice pour from the frozen walls in my mind, pooling behind my eyes. Fleeting images slip through the widening cracks. A grand residence with snarling dragons at the gate. Within that home, a library of scrolls, and a young girl cowering in a beshadowed corner. She works a lock of blond hair between her bruised lips as her trembling fingers trace arcane words across a yellowed parchment. Her eyes are a glacial blue and reflect a longing I know only too well. Every fiber of my being yearns for the peace of my Bleak Expanse. I will return. To my icekin, I have thus promised. For now, I am here, facing the heat. A broken shard of ice in a land of fire, seeking to be made whole once more.

        "Leone: A short, stocky metalsmith, with an obsession for massive metal constructs, Leone is determined to create a golem capable of independent thought. However, due to her lack of aether affinity, she has struggled to find a way to properly animate her beloved creations. While they can follow simple orders, they lack the intelligence and consciousness necessary to interact with the rest of the world, and some of Merle\u2019s former neighbours have taken offense to their occasional involuntary convulsions. It wasn\u2019t the golems\u2019 fault, of course; sometimes other people got too close, and Leone was still working on their threat evaluation.

        "Walking into the tavern, Azalea was greeted by the familiar sound of a high-pitched cackle. She looked over to see the green-haired girl seated at her usual corner, giggling over several vials of questionable substance. Shaking her head, she walked towards the counter, placing her contract card onto the countertop.   Greenbird turned toward her, acknowledging her with a nod. He placed a pouch of \u2018tallics on top of the card, then slid a different contract card onto the counter alongside it. \u201cI have something else for you. One of the gangs is causing some trouble. They keep triggering the tavern\u2019s defenses, and I\u2019m getting fuckin\u2019 tired of getting their blood off the walls. I\u2019ll give you ten silvers for their leader\u2019s head.\u201d With a sigh, Greenbird waved her off, already dismissing her to attend to the busy tavern. Weaving through the crowded tables, she slipped past the guards at the door, keeping a close eye on a nearby group of mercenaries. Once she was clear, Azalea ducked into an alleyway, withdrawing the contract card from her pocket. Flipping it over, she found a single mechanical arm sketched onto the front, a skull nestled just above its elbow.   Arms Dealers. It made sense. She\u2019d had run-ins with a couple of its members on the streets, they were exactly the kind to throw themselves at the tavern. Fucking cults. At the very least, members of the Arms Dealers weren\u2019t hard to identify. Surveying the area around the Tavern provided a number of possible targets, and the visible difference in the quality and complexity of their fake arms made it easy to identify their role within the gang. Choosing a man with a plain, immobile copper arm, she slipped a sleeping draught into his whiskey and waited until he was snoring in his makeshift bed. All things considered, it was a little too easy to kidnap him and tie him to a rooftop. The man glared up at her from underneath his mop of greasy, curly brown hair. He spat at her, laughing wildly while the remaining drool dripped down his chin. Even with several fingers missing, he refused to speak. A few minutes later, when she\u2019d finished disposing of his corpse in the water, she inspected the slowly sinking corpse with a frown. Azalea was going to have to go about this the hard way. Over the years, Azalea had \u2018befriended\u2019 a number of contacts across the Pits, ranging from merchants and squeakers to mercenaries and alchemists. Having such a wide variety of contacts meant that she could gather a variety of information. A merchant, a mercenary and a drunkard could all give her completely different intel on a target. However, when she visited a few of her contacts, not one of them had any information to give. While they\u2019d heard of the Arms Dealers, or seen them around, nobody could actually provide anything beyond that. Azalea made her way to one of her most reliable contacts, who lived in a small shack on the outskirts of the Maw. As an information trader, he was usually more reliable than anyone else she called on for intel, and was also willing to accept jobs from her when the target was a little more difficult to find. It was just a pity it had taken as long as it did to meet him - she could have used his experience when she was first starting out as a merc. Knocking on the front door of his shack, Azalea waited, listening as sounds within abruptly turned into silence. When it came to security, he was almost as careful as she was. Usually, it took him a minute or two to check that it was her, and that she\u2019d come alone. Perfectly on time, she heard the clunk of deadbolts sliding back against the doorframe. The door opened just enough for him to peer around the corner, one hazel eye peeking out at her.   \u201cAzalea! Didn\u2019t expect you for another couple months yet.\u201d Opening the door proper, Barton waved her in, brushing back his greying hair with a grin. \u201cNot that I\u2019m not happy t\u2019 see ya, \u2018course.\u201d As she entered, she glanced around the room, noting the new shelves. \u201cYeah, yeah, needed some more space, y\u2019know? Gotta keep notes.\u201d For some reason, the man insisted on \u2018keeping notes\u2019, though they only ever seemed to consist of rough sketches of people\u2019s faces. At best, they were barely recognisable. At worst, they looked like he\u2019d coughed river water onto the paper and set fire to it. \u201cY\u2019 want some whiskey? \u2018S Blackjack\u2019s.\u201d Of course it was. He never bought anything else. In answer, Azalea retracted a detached metal thumb from her pocket, handing it to him along with the contract card. \u201cAh. This is from one o\u2019 those Arms Dealers. Crazy sods.\u201d Barton paused, looking back and forth between the card, the thumb, and Azalea. \u201cOhhhhh, no. No, absolutely not.\u201d Azalea raised an eyebrow. \u201cNo, I mean it. Last time you got me involved with a fuckin\u2019 cult, I lost me ear and two fingers. They tried to boil me. Boil me, y\u2019 hear? I want nothing to do with those cultists.\u201d Silently, she placed a pouch of \u2018tallics on the table. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not doing it. Have you seen half the weird shit that\u2019s been happening around here lately? I don\u2019t need this shit.\u201d With an exaggerated blink, Azalea added a bottle of Blackjack\u2019s. \u201cNo! I\u2019m not fuckin\u2019 with cults, never again!\u201d \u201c\u2018S not a cult.\u201d \u201cThey chop off their own fuckin\u2019 arms, only cultists are that dumb.\u201d Azalea took a seat, staring at him pointedly. \u201cYou\u2019re really fuckin\u2019 bustin\u2019 my balls here. I want to retire, y\u2019 know. Wanna go up to Metrix, find me a nice robot and settle down. Can\u2019t do that if I\u2019m missin\u2019 my damn head.\u201d When she continued to stare at him, he gave a long, exaggerated groan, flapping a hand at her. \u201cAlright! Alright. Fuck, \u2018zalea, what is it with you and them cultists.\u201d Barton reached for the bottle of Blackjack\u2019s, popping the cork and taking a long swig. With a sigh, he slammed the bottle back onto the table. \u201cRight. Whatd\u2019ya need? Full shebang? You goin\u2019 for the arms o\u2019 the operation? The head? Blackmail? Maybe some connections?\u201d Azalea lifted her hand, slowly dragging her thumb in a line across her throat. \u201cYou\u2019re goin\u2019 straight for the head, huh? Alright. Let me see what I can do.\u201d Shaking his head, he took another swig of the whiskey, sighing heavily. \u201cFuckin\u2019 cults.\u201d   She started by employing some squeakers, sending them to tail groups of Arms Dealers and report back. That done, Azalea began with the second step of her investigation. Alongside their own prosthetic arms, the Arms Dealers had earned a reputation for replacing the limbs of those that crossed them. Rival gang members, traitors, double-agents, and anyone who failed to pay their dues on time often disappeared, resurfacing several days later with tiny, doll-like arms. Azalea found that many of them refused to talk to her, fearing further retribution if they crossed the gang a second time. However, two of them were willing to talk. One could confirm that the Arms Dealers had multiple warehouses and secret hideouts around the Pits, but had never visited any of them. The other was a previous member of the gang, but had never heard of a secret base, or the name of the gang\u2019s leader. Facing that dead end, she resigned herself to commencing step three. With every member of the Arms Dealers possessing a prosthetic arm, she was willing to bet the gang needed a lot of biomancy supplies - something that few others in the Pits had need for. It was all too easy to get the information she needed out of the merchants, tracking the shipments across the Pits. Kneeling on the edge of the rooftop, Azalea looked down on the warehouse below. It was heavily guarded by Arms Dealers, each man carrying at least two weapons. Working around to the closest point of the building, she propelled herself forward, landing lightly on the roof of the warehouse. This close to the guards, Azalea ducked down, keeping a careful eye on the proceedings below. Through the glass, she could see shelves lining the warehouse from wall to wall, all filled with steamtech weaponry. Taking note of the layout, she crept her way down to the edge of the roof, gazing at the guards below. \u201cYeah, gotta be there \u2018fore dawn. The Harvester wants us ready with th\u2019 goods.\u201d \u201cBetter start now, then.\u201d The Harvester. Azalea frowned, watching the two guards as they turned and walked inside. Better follow them. She watched silently from above as they worked to pack the crates full of supplies. One by one, they took them down to the waterfront, shoving them into a boat sitting nearby. Yet when the time came for them to travel, instead of coasting along the perimeter of the Maw, they travelled straight to the edge of the cavern. They\u2019re going to the tunnels. Cursing under her breath, Azalea sank back against the metal, hands clenched into tight fists. There\u2019s no way I can follow them, there aren\u2019t any other boats near here. I\u2019ve just wasted three and a half weeks on finding out the leaders\u2019 fuckin\u2019 name. Shoving her bow back into its position on her back, she stalked to the edge of the roof, throwing herself in the direction of Barton\u2019s hut. Hopefully, he\u2019d have some kind of information for her by now. Except, when she caught sight of the area where his little hut sat, she immediately came to a halt. The front door was missing, ripped off its hinges, heavy footprints dug into the soil in front of his house. One of the glass panes had been broken, and she could smell the faint scent of smoke in the air. After carefully scouting the area, Azalea made her way toward the hut, sending an arrow flying through the broken windowpane. When all remained still, she slowly entered through the front door. The tiny living area had been completely trashed. Barton\u2019s bed, his chests and shelves had been upturned, their contents scattered about the room. Blood covered the walls in streaks and splashes, as if it had been deliberately thrown around. In the centre of it all sat Barton, or what remained of him. His corpse was perched on a chair, his removed limbs lying nearby. In their place, the humerus bones had been sharpened to thin points, his eyeballs skewered onto the ends. His legs were replaced by sticks of dynamite, his detached head pinned to the wall behind him. They\u2019d left his eye sockets empty, the trails of muscle left dangling down his face. His skin hung off him in tatters, revealing the dark glisten of muscle underneath. In some places, the bones burst through, the points of his ribcage piercing through his abdomen. It looked like at some point, his stomach had ruptured - in addition to the sharp, acrid scent of bile in the air, she could see it coating what remained of his clothes.   Shit. Jaw clenched, Azalea stepped closer, ignoring the pungent smell to the air around the corpse. Emptying his pockets, she found three coppers, four lockpicks and a piece of flint, tucking them into one of her pouches. The rest of the clutter she left, looking around the room to check for anything else she could use. Fuck, Barton was a rare find. I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019ll be before I find another information trader like that. Her hands curled into fists, eyes narrowed to dark slits. Useless. Armed with no leads, no clues, her contracts in hiding or dead, and her only information to date the Harvester\u2019s name, her hand was forced. Azalea pulled the contract card from her pocket, clenching it in her fist. There\u2019s still one thing I can do.   Greenbird stood at the bar, his face set into a deep frown as he looked over the tavern. Most of the tables were empty, his mercenaries having long since made themselves scarce, along with most of the tavern\u2019s usual patrons. The Blackjack\u2019s Tavern was one of the best established contract grounds in the Pits, and no other mercenary group could possibly hope to compete. As a result, Greenbird had lived through multiple attempted coups, maintaining control of the tavern through a well-established instinct for when things were about to take a turn for the worse\u2026 and an empty tavern always meant that trouble was brewing. With a long-suffering sigh, Greenbird ushered over one of his staff, gesturing to the door. \u201cHog, get Moray and Jackdaw from outside. Cobbs, you gather the mercs. As many as possible.\u201d While Hog nodded, running to the entrance, silence followed Greenbird\u2019s command. \u201cCobbs.\u201d Greenbird turned just in time to see the man in question collapse to the floor, snoring loudly. He bent down, feeling the man\u2019s pulse with two fingers. \u201cFuck.\u201d Listening carefully, he heard the sound of a body hitting the floor outside; a sure sign that Hog had succumbed to the sleeping draught as well. Gathering his skirts in one hand, Greenbird turned and crossed the room, one hand on the gun at his side. Just as he reached the back door, it opened, revealing three men standing between Greenbird and his escape route. The tallest of the three stood with a careless swagger, lips stretched into a grin. Dressed in his pinstripe suit, his greasy hair slicked back, he could have almost been mistaken for a citizen of Metrix, if the facial scarring and burns marks on his one good arm hadn\u2019t given him away. With a nod, he gestured to the men standing either side of him, their guns pointed directly at Greenbird\u2019s head. \u201cDrop y\u2019 weapon, birdy.\u201d Reluctantly, Greenbird dropped his gun, gaze fixed on the apparent leader of the group. Behind him, he could hear the rest of the group enter the tavern, their footsteps echoing in the now-empty room. A glance over his shoulder confirmed that all of them were also bearing prosthetic arms and steamtech weapons. \u201cPlanning on doin\u2019 a runner, were ya?\u201d The man laughed, shaking his head. \u201cNah, that ain\u2019t gonna fly. You\u2019re staying right here.\u201d \u201cI take it you\u2019re in charge of these half-wits,\u201d Greenbird drawled, chuckling darkly. \u201cI don\u2019t remember inviting you into my tavern. \u201cMy tavern,\u201d the man corrected, gesturing to the room around him as he stepped closer. \u201cAllow me to introduce myself. I\u2019m known \u2018round these parts as the Harvester. Head of the Arms Dealers, and now, owner of the Blackjack\u2019s Tavern.\u201d \u201cYou? The Blackjack\u2019s Tavern?\u201d Greenbird laughed. \u201cNo fuckin\u2019 way. You couldn\u2019t hold this place down for five damn minutes before it fell apart. You ain\u2019t takin\u2019 this place from me.\u201d \u201cAnd how\u2019re you planning to stop me? Your mercs are long gone, we got past your defenses, and we\u2019ve blocked off your escape route. I know you don\u2019t have any tricks left up your sleeves.\u201d The Harvester paused, looking at Greenbird thoughtfully. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve made arms before, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever made someone a wing. Been thinkin\u2019 \u2018bout it a lot, actually. What d\u2019ya think? Wood, or copper?\u201d The Harvester\u2019s obnoxious laughter filled the tavern, shoulders shaking, face slowly beginning to turn red. Greenbird watched silently, eyes narrowed, lip curling into an expression of distaste. Yet as he watched, he noticed a brief, faint flash of light, the signature gleam of an arrowhead flashing in the shadows. Raising an eyebrow, he took a quick look around the room. Fourteen. With a sigh, the Harvester wiped away a non-existent tear, flapping a hand in Greenbird\u2019s direction. \u201cGet him out of here. I want him strung from the rooftop.\u201d Just as one of the men placed a hand on Greenbird\u2019s shoulder, he froze, making a strange wheezing sound. Greenbird glanced down to see an arrow embedded in the man\u2019s chest, piercing his lung. With a gasp, the man fell to his knees, one hand wrapped around the end of the arrow as blood dribbled from the corner of his mouth. Thirteen. As the woman on the right went to step toward him, an arrow struck her, piercing the soft flesh just behind her temple. Blood oozed down the side of her face, rapidly staining her skin a dark shade of crimson. A moment later, another arrow pierced her throat, her eyelids twitching as she collapsed to the ground. Twelve. With a shout, the Arms Dealers leapt into action, backs to one another as they looked to the shadows, trying to find their attacker. The Harvester shouted orders, ducking behind the counter. Yet even as he tried to corral his men, another two fell, shot down before they could draw a breath to shout. Ten. Greenbird slowly began to back away from the chaos, watching as the Arms Dealers began firing randomly, spattering the tavern walls with bullets. A lit arrow streaked through the room, a trail of orange light, striking one of the men and instantly lighting him on fire. His screaming filled the room, blocking out the sound of two more arrows finding their mark. Seven. ...Five. Azalea\u2019s face flashed in the lantern light as she kicked open the tavern door, pulling back her bowstring and loosing another three arrows in quick succession. The man closest to her gurgled as he dropped to the ground, blood trickling down the lines of the wooden floor. Another arrow struck through one man\u2019s eye, piercing through the socket, his one good eye rolling back into his head as he fell. Two. As the remaining Arms Dealer turned on his heel, aiming his steam rifle in her direction, Azalea had already loaded another arrow into her bow, taking aim. The arrowhead easily pierced his chest, a sharp whistle escaping the man as it perforated his lung. With a wheeze, he collapsed to his knees, clutching at the arrow as he tried to breathe. Closing the space between them, Azalea grabbed the man by the hair, pulling him up to his knees. A silver dagger flashed in the light as she slit his throat, dropping him unceremoniously. One. Finally, the Harvester was the only one left, his gun held aloft as he ducked out from behind the counter. The instant he appeared, before he had time to react, the thwack of a bowstring sounded as an arrow pierced his skull. This one was slightly thicker than the others, the fletching longer and wider. As the Harvester stood there, frozen, his skull suddenly detonated, sending chunks of brain matter, blood and skull fragments flying across the room.   Greenbird slowly raised one hand to wipe the blood splatter from his face, his expression thunderous. There was a strip of skin dangling from his bodice, the Harvester\u2019s hair still attached to the piece of scalp. Pinching the hair between the tips of his fingers, he flung it one side, expression twisting into a look of disgust. Azalea slowly crossed the remaining distance, the clack of her boots near-silent against the wooden tavern floors. Side-stepping a smoking corpse, she stared silently at Greenbird, her grey eyes sharp as she raised a single eyebrow questioningly. \u201cUsing me as fuckin\u2019 bait? Really?\u201d He scoffed, gesturing to the tavern around him. \u201cMy tavern is a fuckin\u2019 mess. My patrons\u2019ve all been scared off, most o\u2019 me mercs are long gone. Do you have any-\u201d Azalea remained silent, extending a hand towards Greenbird, the contract card held between two fingers. The tavern owner shot her a death glare as he made toward the bar, cursing all the while. \u201cTavern\u2019s neutral ground. They shouldn\u2019t have been here. Shouldn\u2019t have known about half the shit they knew.\u201d He looked over to meet Azalea\u2019s deadpan gaze, his expression dour. \u201cHow\u2019d they get that information?\u201d She shrugged in response. \u201cThere,\u201d he spat, tossing a pouch of \u2018tallics across the counter. \u201cThere\u2019s your coin. Now get these bodies the hell out of my tavern.\u201d",

        "In the Demonastery, the immoral and taboo are no limit to human ingenuity. Forbidden magics, occult studies, and heinous experiments are all welcome within its dimly-lit halls, where the endless pursuit of knowledge is the only matter of any consequence.",

        "In the shadow of Mt. Volcor, with the earth rumbling beneath, Dromai stands amidst ruins, her eyes sharp and searching for her brother, Fai. Born of the same blood, they were split by the turmoil of their land, divided by the Ember Divide. Dromai, nurtured in Ashvahan's deceptive opulence, and Fai, raised among outcasts in the wilds, embody their draconian heritage yet tread vastly different paths. Dromai remembers the day of their separation vividly: their village burning, their mother's screams, Fai taken by insurgents, and herself, left in the hands of a manipulative guardian. These memories haunt her, a constant specter amidst her achievements. Now, with Volcor in disarray after the Emperor's assassination, Dromai seeks to reunite with Fai. She navigates through the aftermath of battle, aware that power reigns supreme in Volcor. Rumors of Fai, now a revered leader of the insurgents known as the Phoenix's talon, reach her ears. Her journey brings her to a vista overlooking the Red Desert, the stronghold of the rebellion. There, against the backdrop of a blood-orange sky, she spots Fai, a figure of defiance and leadership. Descending towards the encampment, Dromai is torn between emotions and uncertainty. She questions how Fai will perceive her: as a sibling or a symbol of their shared suffering. Their meeting is poignant, time pausing as Fai acknowledges her with a mix of weariness and wonder. Dromai, fighting back tears, declares her intentions not for pity or forgiveness, but for understanding and reconnecting their fractured bond. She speaks of their shared blood and the fate of Volcor hanging in the balance. Fai, cautiously optimistic, asks if she comes as an emissary or kin. Dromai replies with quiet determination, expressing her desire to mend their family's torn tapestry, and to decide their role in the empire's impending transformation. They stand together, symbols of a past era, their futures entwined with Volcor's destiny. A silent recognition passes between them, acknowledging the challenges ahead and the potential strength in their unity. In Rathe's world of eternal war and fleeting peace, Dromai and Fai, bound by blood, symbolize the enduring spirit of Volcor's children, striving to forge a new path amidst the ruins of a once-great empire."
